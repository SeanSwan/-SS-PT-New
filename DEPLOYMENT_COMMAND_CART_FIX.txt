git add . && git commit -m "feat: P0 CRITICAL FIX - Cart totals calculation bug (DECIMAL type handling)

🚨 URGENT: Fix cart showing $0 total for $175 items - DECIMAL type issue resolved

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
❌ calculateCartTotals: typeof item.price !== 'number' validation FAILING
❌ Sequelize returns DECIMAL fields as STRINGS, not numbers
❌ Validation failure caused entire item calculation to be SKIPPED
❌ Result: Cart total = $0 despite $175 item in cart

COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED:
✅ Removed incorrect typeof item.price !== 'number' validation
✅ Added proper DECIMAL string handling with parseFloat()
✅ Enhanced price validation with NaN and value checks
✅ Updated all calculations to use parsed price values
✅ Added critical debugging for price types from database

TECHNICAL SOLUTION:
- BEFORE: if (typeof item.price !== 'number') return; // SKIPPED CALCULATION
- AFTER: const itemPrice = typeof item.price === 'string' ? parseFloat(item.price) : item.price;
- RESULT: Proper handling of Sequelize DECIMAL fields

IMPACT:
🎯 Fixes P0 cart total calculation showing $0 for valid items
🎯 Resolves $175 Silver Swan Wing package displaying $0 total
🎯 Enables proper cart checkout functionality
🎯 Fixes payment processing integration

DEPLOYMENT PROGRESSION:
✅ Fix #1: orderRoutes.mjs - Server startup (SUCCESS)
✅ Fix #2: workoutService.mjs - Server startup (SUCCESS)  
✅ Fix #3: notificationService.mjs - Server startup (SUCCESS)
🎯 Fix #4: cartHelpers.mjs - CRITICAL cart calculation bug (CURRENT)

This represents a CRITICAL P0 production bug fix for cart functionality.
