--- End DIFF SUMMARY ---

üöß Open Issues/Blockers:
  - Need to implement real MCP service integration for admin dashboard
  - Several placeholder components need implementation in TrainerDashboardRoutes
  - Need to test further with real user data

üí° Potential New Issues/Watchouts:
  - The toggle between classic and enhanced views in admin dashboard may cause confusion
  - Performance with large client lists needs monitoring
  - MCP hook error handling could be improved

‚è≠Ô∏è Recommended Next Steps:
  - Create real MCP server implementations for the admin dashboard
  - Implement remaining placeholder components in TrainerDashboardRoutes
  - Add pagination for client lists to improve performance with many clients
  - Create a unified API service layer for consistent data access across all dashboards
  - Add comprehensive unit tests for all dashboard components
  - **GIT PUSH REMINDER:** Consider pushing these stable changes to your Git repository.

## Dashboard Tab Synchronization

The implementation now ensures consistent tabs across all three user roles:

1. **Client Dashboard**
   - Overview
   - Workouts
   - Progress (connected to MCP)
   - Sessions
   - Gamification (connected to MCP)
   - Creative Hub
   - Community
   - Profile
   - Settings

2. **Trainer Dashboard**
   - Dashboard
   - Client Progress (connected to MCP)
   - Workouts
   - Sessions
   - Packages
   - Gamification (connected to MCP)
   - Community
   - Clients

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Dashboard
   - Client Progress (connected to MCP)
   - Workouts
   - Sessions
   - Packages
   - Gamification (connected to MCP)
   - Community
   - User Management

This synchronization ensures a consistent user experience across all roles while maintaining role-specific functionality. The DashboardSelector component allows easy navigation between dashboards based on user permissions.

## MCP Integration

All progress-related components now connect to both the workout and gamification MCP servers:

1. **useClientDashboardMcp Hook**: Provides access to progress, gamification, and training program data
2. **useGamificationMcp Hook**: Provides specialized access to gamification features
3. **workoutMcpService**: Handles workout and progress data
4. **gamificationMcpService**: Handles gamification data

These components work together to provide a comprehensive and consistent data layer across all dashboards.
