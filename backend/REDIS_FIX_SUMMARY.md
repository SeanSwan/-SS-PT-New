# Redis Connection Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The SwanStudios backend was experiencing repeated Redis connection errors:
```
[ioredis] Unhandled error event: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
```

These errors were occurring even though Redis was disabled in the environment configuration (`REDIS_ENABLED=false`).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. Multiple services attempting to connect to Redis despite it being disabled
2. Insufficient error handling in the Redis wrapper
3. Lack of pre-connection availability checks
4. Potentially some auto-importing behavior creating Redis clients

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Environment Configuration
Updated `.env` file to be more explicit about Redis being disabled:
```env
# Redis Configuration (Disabled by default)
# Set REDIS_ENABLED=true to enable Redis caching
# WARNING: Ensure Redis server is running on localhost:6379 before enabling
REDIS_ENABLED=false
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=5000
REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=0
```

### 2. Improved Redis Wrapper
Enhanced `services/cache/redisWrapper.mjs` with:
- Early environment variable checking
- Pre-connection availability testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Complete connection cleanup on errors
- Lazy initialization to prevent unnecessary connection attempts
- Disable auto-reconnection features

### 3. Redis Connection Prevention Systems
Added two layers of Redis connection prevention:

#### `utils/redisConnectionPreventer.mjs`
- Provides Redis availability checking without connecting
- Implements Redis connection blocking for disabled configurations

#### `utils/redisConnectionFix.mjs`
- Applies early Redis prevention measures
- Sets global flags to prevent any Redis connections
- Provides comprehensive logging about Redis status

### 4. Early Server Initialization Checks
Modified `server.mjs` to:
- Apply Redis fixes before any other imports
- Check Redis availability during startup
- Log Redis status clearly

## Results
After implementing these changes:
1. Redis connection errors should be eliminated
2. All caching operations use in-memory fallback
3. Clear logging indicates Redis is disabled
4. No performance impact on the application
5. System continues to function normally with memory cache

## Configuration
Redis remains disabled by default. To enable Redis in the future:
1. Ensure Redis server is running on localhost:6379
2. Set `REDIS_ENABLED=true` in the environment
3. Restart the backend server

## Testing
The system should now start without Redis connection errors and operate normally using memory cache for all caching operations.
