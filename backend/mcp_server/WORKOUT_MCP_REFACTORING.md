# 📋 SESSION SUMMARY

## 🎯 Goal of Session:
Refactor the workout MCP server from a monolithic file into a modular, maintainable structure following best practices from the master prompt, including proper configuration management, database abstraction, and error handling.

## ✅ Completed Tasks:
- Analyzed the existing workout MCP server structure
- Created a new main.py entry point file for the server
- Implemented secure configuration management
- Added database abstraction with in-memory and SQL placeholders
- Created proper API client utilities
- Ensured error handling and logging throughout
- Created documentation and a launcher script

--- End DIFF SUMMARY ---

## 🚧 Open Issues/Blockers:
- The server still uses in-memory data storage (no persistent database)
- More comprehensive testing is needed
- API endpoints might need adjusting based on the actual backend API implementation

## 💡 Potential New Issues/Watchouts:
- When implementing actual database connections, ensure proper connection pooling and error handling
- Monitor API request performance with larger datasets
- Security for API tokens needs implementation in a production environment
- Consider implementing rate limiting for MCP tools

## ⏭️ Recommended Next Steps:
1. Test the refactored server with actual API requests
2. Implement actual database connections using SQLAlchemy
3. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. Set up monitoring and logging for production deployment
5. Enhance error handling with more specific error codes and messages
