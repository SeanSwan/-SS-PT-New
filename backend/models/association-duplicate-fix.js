/**
 * BACKEND ASSOCIATION FIX - DUPLICATE ALIAS RESOLUTION
 * ====================================================
 * 
 * Fixed duplicate association alias error in associations.mjs
 * 
 * Problem: 
 * - Multiple Challenge associations using the same "creator" alias
 * - Sequelize error: "You have used the alias creator in two separate associations"
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Removed duplicate Challenge association sections
 * 2. Consolidated into single definitive Challenge associations
 * 3. Ensured all required associations (Goal, ProgressData, UserFollow) are properly defined
 * 4. Removed redundant "NEW GAMIFICATION ASSOCIATIONS" section
 * 
 * Result:
 * - Single set of Challenge associations with unique aliases
 * - All required gamification associations preserved
 * - Backend should now start successfully
