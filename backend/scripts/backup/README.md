# StoreFront Scripts Backup

These scripts have been moved to this backup directory as they are no longer needed.

The StoreFront component now uses hardcoded packages directly in the component code, eliminating the need for database scripts to manage package data.

Files were moved here on May 19, 2025 as part of the cleanup process to simplify the system architecture and eliminate API dependency for package data.

If you need to restore database-driven package functionality, you can move these files back to the parent directory.
