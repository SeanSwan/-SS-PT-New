/**
 * Redis Fix Summary
 * ================
 * 
 * ISSUE: Redis connection attempts were occurring even when REDIS_ENABLED=false,
 * causing "[ioredis] Unhandled error event" messages in the console.
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE: The redisWrapper.mjs was importing ioredis at module load time,
 * which created a Redis client instance that would attempt to connect regardless
 * of the REDIS_ENABLED setting.
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 1. Modified redisWrapper.mjs to use dynamic imports (await import('ioredis'))
 *    only when Redis is actually enabled AND the server is reachable
 * 2. Removed error suppression utilities as they're no longer needed
 * 3. The wrapper now truly prevents any ioredis instantiation when disabled
 * 
 * TECHNICAL DETAILS:
 * - Changed from static import to dynamic import of ioredis
 * - Added pre-connection availability check using native Node.js net module
 * - Only loads ioredis module if Redis is enabled AND server is reachable
 * - Maintains full in-memory cache fallback functionality
 * 
 * BENEFITS:
 * - No more Redis connection error messages when Redis is disabled
 * - Cleaner codebase without error suppression hacks
 * - More efficient as ioredis module is not loaded when not needed
 * - True separation of concerns - Redis wrapper only loads Redis when required
 * 
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * - services/cache/redisWrapper.mjs: Implemented dynamic import approach
 * - server.mjs: Removed error suppressor import
 * 
 * FILES NO LONGER NEEDED:
 * - utils/redisErrorSuppressor.mjs (error suppression no longer needed)
 * - utils/redisBlocker.mjs (if exists, redundant with new approach)
 * 
 * VERIFICATION:
 * With REDIS_ENABLED=false, start the server and verify:
 * 1. No Redis connection error messages appear
 * 2. Application functions normally with memory cache
 * 3. Redis wrapper logs show "Redis is disabled" message
 * 4. Memory cache operations work as expected
 * 
 * This solution follows Gemini's recommendation to fix the root cause
 * rather than suppress symptoms.
