# Admin Dashboard Route Alignment Complete ✅

## Problem Identified and Fixed

**Issue**: All admin dashboard sidebar navigation tabs were pointing to the same route because the sidebar navigation routes didn't match the actual defined routes in the layout.

**Root Cause**: 
- Sidebar routes had prefix `/dashboard/admin/` (e.g., `/dashboard/admin/overview`)
- Actual layout routes were `/dashboard/` (e.g., `/dashboard/default`)

## Route Alignment Fixed ✅

### ✅ Updated Navigation Routes in `AdminStellarSidebar.tsx`

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
{ id: 'overview', route: '/dashboard/admin/overview' }
{ id: 'user-management', route: '/dashboard/admin/user-management' }
{ id: 'trainer-management', route: '/dashboard/admin/trainer-management' }
// ... all routes had incorrect /dashboard/admin/ prefix
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
{ id: 'overview', route: '/dashboard/default' }
{ id: 'user-management', route: '/dashboard/user-management' }
{ id: 'trainers', route: '/dashboard/trainers' }
// ... all routes now match actual layout routes
```
