## 🎯 FOR SEAN: YOUR ONE FILE TO RULE THEM ALL

### **📄 LAZY & FORGETFUL? USE THIS ONE PROMPT:**

**File:** [AI-VILLAGE-MASTER-ONBOARDING-PROMPT-V2.md](AI-VILLAGE-MASTER-ONBOARDING-PROMPT-V2.md) ⭐⭐⭐

**What it does:**
1. Copy the ENTIRE file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
2. Paste into ANY AI (Claude Code, Roo Code, MinMax v2, Kilo Code/DeepSeek Prover, Gemini, ChatGPT)
3. The AI auto-detects its role and knows EVERYTHING:
   - What it should do
   - How to coordinate with other AIs
   - Where to find all files
   - Design workflow (no code without asking!)
   - How to use shared files (CURRENT-TASK.md, status files)

**Use this prompt EVERY TIME you start a session with an AI.**

**Bookmark this file!** 🔖 It's your "one prompt for everything."

## ✅ The 7-Checkpoint Pipeline

Every feature must pass all 7 checkpoints before Git push:

1. **Code Quality** (Roo Code) - 3 min
2. **Logic Review** (Gemini) - 4 min
3. **Security Review** (Claude Desktop) - 6 min
4. **Testing Review** (ChatGPT-5) - 7 min
5. **Performance Review** (Codex) - 4 min
6. **Integration Review** (Claude Code) - 5 min
7. **Human Review** (You) - 8 min

**Total:** 35-45 minutes per feature
**Bugs Prevented:** 95%+ caught before production
**Cost:** ~$0.01 per feature

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Week 1:** Focus on execution
- Use QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md
- Follow YOUR-DAILY-WORKFLOW-CHECKLIST.md religiously
- Don't worry about optimizing yet

**Week 2-4:** Optimize workflow
- Refine AI prompts based on what works
- Track which AI catches most bugs
- Adjust Fast Track criteria

**Month 2+:** Scale up
- Transition to fuller AI Village workflow
- Add more sophisticated quality gates
- Document your own patterns

---

## 🚨 Important Rules

### NEVER Skip the Pipeline
- **Every feature** must pass all 7 checkpoints (or approved Fast Track variant)
- 30 minutes in pipeline saves 2-4 hours debugging production
- Zero exceptions for "quick fixes"

### Pipeline Variants
- **FULL** (all 7): New features, security code, DB changes
- **FAST TRACK** (1,2,4,7): UI polish, minor bug fixes, styling
- **CRITICAL PATH** (1,2,3,4,6,7): Security patches, data privacy

### Git Push Rules
- Only push if all checkpoints = ✅ PASS
- Include "Passed all 7 AI review checkpoints" in commit message
- If ANY checkpoint fails → fix → re-run from that checkpoint

---

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

Weekly tracking (use template from QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md):
- Features shipped (target: 5-10/week)
- Pipeline compliance (target: 100%)
- Bugs found in production (target: 0)
- Bugs caught by pipeline (celebrate!)
- Time per feature (target: <2hrs)
- Total AI spend (target: <$65/mo)

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If Stuck on a Checkpoint
1. Read the AI's feedback carefully
2. Fix the specific issue mentioned
3. Re-run from THAT checkpoint (not from #1)
4. If stuck after 3 attempts → ask Claude Desktop for architectural guidance

### If Tools Are Down
- **Roo Code down?** → Use Codex (GPT-4 in VS Code) as fallback
- **OpenRouter down?** → Use Claude Code for backend coding
- **Gemini down?** → Use v0.dev for frontend, then Claude Code for integration

### If You Find a Bug in Production
1. Don't panic - even with AI Village, you'll still catch 95%+ (not 100%)
2. Create hotfix branch
3. Run FULL pipeline even for small fix
4. Post-mortem: "Which checkpoint should have caught this?"
5. Update that checkpoint's prompt
