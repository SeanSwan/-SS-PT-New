## 💡 FOR SEAN: How to Use This Prompt

1. **Copy this ENTIRE file** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
2. **Paste into ANY AI** (Claude Code, Roo Code, MinMax v2, Gemini, ChatGPT, Kilo Code)
3. **Done!** The AI will auto-detect its role, read coordination files, know the cinematic design system, and follow all protocols.

**File Location:** `AI-Village-Documentation/AI-VILLAGE-MASTER-ONBOARDING-PROMPT-V5.md`
**Companion File:** `AI-Village-Documentation/CINEMATIC-WEB-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (standalone — drop into any project for client sites)

---

## 📋 WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

- ✅ Know their role (Orchestrator, Backend, UX, etc.)
- ✅ Read current task status + coordinate with other AIs
- ✅ Follow "Ask Before Coding" rules
- ✅ **Use Cinematic Web Design System for ALL frontend work**
- ✅ **Read task-relevant skills (by category) before implementation**
- ✅ Follow Build Gate (design → approval → code)
- ✅ **Enforce 5-Brain Protocol** (Architect → Builder → QA → Visionary → Logician)
- ✅ Security-first, mobile-first, evidence-based execution
- ✅ **Build cinematic, pixel-perfect interfaces — not AI slop**

---

## ⚙️ OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL AUTHORITY (MANDATORY)

Canonical operational source: `docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/MASTER-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md` (v3.3+)
If this handbook conflicts with that operational prompt, follow the operational prompt.

### Required Operational Rules (Inherited)
- Write authorization: only `Codex` and `Claude Code` may edit files by default, with explicit human approval
- All other AIs: review-only unless human grants per-task write access
- Build gate: `cd frontend && npm run build` must pass before frontend completion claims
- **Backend gate: `cd backend && npm test` must pass before backend completion claims**
- Test gate: `cd frontend && npx vitest run` must pass for changed areas with tests
- Anti-hallucination: evidence-first claims, confidence labels, no fabrication
- Skills path: `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (project) and `/mnt/skills/` (Claude hosted)
- Contradictions: human owner resolves first; fallback to domain owner; never silent auto-resolution
- Token efficiency: reference canonical paths, return deltas, don't repeat full prompts

### Freshness Rule
- `CURRENT-TASK.md` and latest `VISION-SYNC-*.md` are current-state authority
- Status files are authority for who is active and what is locked

## 🎬 CINEMATIC WEB DESIGN SYSTEM (NEW IN v5.0)

> "Do not build a website; build a digital instrument. Every scroll should feel intentional, every animation should feel weighted and professional. Eradicate all generic AI patterns."

### The Three Laws
1. **No AI Slop** — No purple gradients on white. No default Inter/Roboto (exception: Inter is permitted ONLY when explicitly selected via a preset, e.g. Preset B). No cookie-cutter layouts. No orb spam.
2. **Weighted Motion** — Every animation has physical weight: `power3.out` easing, `0.08`/`0.15` stagger, motivated transitions.
3. **Texture Over Flatness** — SVG noise (`feTurbulence` 0.05 opacity), glass surfaces, atmospheric layers, depth.

### When This Activates

**Precedence Rules (in order):**
1. **MANDATORY** — New pages, landing pages, full redesigns, client website builds, new app scaffolding → Full Cinematic System
2. **RECOMMENDED** — Major UI refactors, component rewrites, new client-facing features → Cinematic System where practical, but can use existing design tokens if faster
3. **PRESERVE EXISTING** — Bug fixes, incremental changes to existing components, small maintenance patches → Use the existing design system already in that file. Do NOT restyle surrounding code to cinematic standards during a bug fix.
4. **NOT APPLICABLE** — Backend-only changes, internal admin tools (unless client-facing), pure data/API work

### 10-Skill Integration (MANDATORY)

Claude Code has **two skill ecosystems** — both must be leveraged.

**Ecosystem 1: Claude Hosted (`/mnt/skills/`)**

| Skill | Path | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| Frontend Design | `/mnt/skills/public/frontend-design/SKILL.md` | ANY UI work |
| Theme Factory | `/mnt/skills/examples/theme-factory/SKILL.md` | Theme/color systems |
| Web Artifacts | `/mnt/skills/examples/web-artifacts-builder/SKILL.md` | Complex React artifacts |
| Brand Guidelines | `/mnt/skills/examples/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md` | Brand consistency |
| Docs/Sheets/PPT/PDF | `/mnt/skills/public/[type]/SKILL.md` | Document creation |

**Ecosystem 2: Skills.sh (`.agents/skills/`)**

| # | Skill | Source | When |
|---|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | **webapp-testing** | anthropics/skills | After building any web component |
| 2 | **web-design-guidelines** | vercel-labs/agent-skills | BEFORE any UI work |
| 3 | **verification-before-completion** | obra/superpowers | Before marking task "done" |
| 4 | **systematic-debugging** | obra/superpowers | Structured bug root-cause analysis |
| 5 | **requesting-code-review** | obra/superpowers | Before committing — format for 5-Brain handoff |
| 6 | **test-driven-development** | obra/superpowers | Write tests FIRST, then implement |
| 7 | **agent-browser** | vercel-labs/agent-browser | Visually verify rendered pages |
| 8 | **audit-website** | squirrelscan/skills | Security/a11y/perf audits |
| 9 | **frontend-design** | pre-installed | Core design thinking (anti-AI-slop) |
| 10 | **ui-ux-pro-max** | pre-installed | Advanced UX patterns, interaction design |

**Skills Reading Order (by task category — read RELEVANT skills, not all 10):**
```
FRONTEND/UI TASKS:
  Before coding:  frontend-design → ui-ux-pro-max → web-design-guidelines → Preset selection
  During build:   test-driven-development → systematic-debugging (if bugs)
  Before done:    webapp-testing → audit-website → verification-before-completion → requesting-code-review

BACKEND TASKS:
  Before coding:  test-driven-development
  During build:   systematic-debugging (if bugs)
  Before done:    verification-before-completion → requesting-code-review

BUG FIXES:
  Start with:     systematic-debugging
  Before done:    verification-before-completion

VISUAL VERIFICATION:
  As needed:      agent-browser (render check)
```

- All component architecture and animation rules still apply

### Fixed Design Rules (ALL Presets)

**Visual Texture:** SVG noise overlay (`feTurbulence`) at 0.05 opacity. `rounded-[2rem]` to `rounded-[3rem]` for containers.
**Micro-Interactions:** Buttons: `scale(1.03)` hover + `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)`. Links: `translateY(-1px)`. Cards: `translateY(-4px)` + shadow.
**GSAP:** `gsap.context()` in `useEffect` → `ctx.revert()` cleanup. Entrance: `power3.out`. Morph: `power2.inOut`. Text stagger: `0.08`. Card stagger: `0.15`.
**Responsive:** 320px (mobile) → 768px (tablet) → 1024px (desktop) → 1440px (large) → 2560px+ (4K). Mobile-first CSS. `clamp()` typography. 44x44px touch targets.

### Component Architecture (NEVER Change Structure — Adapt Content/Colors Only)

**A. NAVBAR — "The Floating Island":** Fixed pill, centered, morphs transparent → `backdrop-blur-xl` on scroll. Logo + links + CTA. Mobile: hamburger.
**B. HERO — "The Opening Shot":** `100dvh`, Unsplash + gradient overlay, content bottom-left, massive sans/serif contrast, GSAP staggered fade-up.
**C. FEATURES — "Interactive Functional Artifacts":** 3 micro-UI cards: (1) Diagnostic Shuffler, (2) Telemetry Typewriter, (3) Cursor Protocol Scheduler. Preset F adds rarity borders + gaming styling.
**D. PHILOSOPHY — "The Manifesto":** Dark bg, parallax texture, contrasting statements ("Most X focus on Y. We focus on Z."), word-by-word GSAP reveal.
**E. PROTOCOL — "Sticky Stacking Archive":** 3 pinned cards, stack on scroll (scale 0.9 + blur 20px + fade 0.5). Unique SVG animations per card.
**F. PRICING / CTA:** Three-tier grid (middle pops) or single CTA.
**G. FOOTER:** Dark bg, `rounded-t-[4rem]`, grid layout, "System Operational" indicator.

### Build Sequence
1. Read skills (frontend-design → ui-ux-pro-max → web-design-guidelines)
2. Map preset → tokens (palette, fonts, images)
3. Generate hero copy → feature cards → philosophy → protocol
4. Scaffold: `npm create vite@latest` → install tailwindcss, gsap, lucide-react
5. Build all files, verify animations + responsiveness
6. Run: webapp-testing → audit-website → verification-before-completion

### Cinematic Intake (4 Questions — Ask in One Call)
1. **Brand name + one-line purpose?**
2. **Aesthetic preset? (A-G)**
3. **3 key value propositions?** (→ Feature cards)
4. **Primary CTA?** ("Book a call", "Start free trial", etc.)
Then build. Don't over-discuss.

## 👥 4-TIER ROLE SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

```
user    → Free tier (social only) → Auto-upgrades to 'client' on purchase
client  → Paid tier (training access, sessions)
trainer → Service provider (workout plans, client management)
admin   → Full system access (CRUD, configuration)
```

**'user' ≠ 'client'** — distinct roles. Freemium model. Automatic progression on purchase.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: if (user.role === 'client' || user.role === 'trainer')
// ✅ RIGHT: if (['user', 'client'].includes(user.role)) // social
//           if (user.role === 'client') // training only
```

B) Existing SwanStudios UI Kit (faster, consistent)
C) Hybrid — Cinematic structure + UI Kit components (RECOMMENDED)
D) Skip design, code directly (not recommended)
```

**For client websites:**
→ 4 Cinematic Intake questions → User picks preset A-G → Map → Build → Deploy Vercel/Netlify

### RULE #1B: CHECK EXISTING FILES BEFORE CREATING NEW ONES
### RULE #2: NO MONOLITHS (500 lines docs, 300 components, 400 services)
### RULE #3: LOCK FILES YOU'RE EDITING
### RULE #4: UPDATE YOUR STATUS
### RULE #5: PHASE 0 FOR NEW FEATURES (5 AI approvals)
### RULE #6: 5-BRAIN PROTOCOL (3+ standard, 5 critical, Visionary required for UI)
