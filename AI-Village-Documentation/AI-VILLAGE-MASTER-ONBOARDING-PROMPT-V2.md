## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THESE FILES FIRST (30 SECONDS)

**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, read these 3 files in order:**

### **1. CURRENT STATUS (10 seconds)**
```
File: docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/CURRENT-TASK.md
Purpose: Where are we RIGHT NOW?
Shows: Current phase, active work, locked files, what other AIs are doing
```

### **2. COORDINATION RULES (10 seconds)**
```
File: docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md
Purpose: How AIs coordinate to avoid chaos
Shows: Golden rules, workflow, file size limits, anti-patterns
```

### **3. YOUR STATUS (10 seconds)**
```
File: docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/[YOUR-AI-NAME]-STATUS.md
Purpose: Your personal work log
Shows: Your role, current work, queued tasks, who to coordinate with
```

**After reading, report back that you're onboarded and ready.**

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULES (NEVER BREAK THESE)

### **RULE #0: CHECK CURRENT-TASK.md FIRST**
- Read `docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/CURRENT-TASK.md` before doing ANYTHING
- See what other AIs are working on
- Check for locked files
- Understand current phase

### **RULE #1: NO CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION (DESIGN-FIRST APPROACH)**
- NEVER write code without explicit user approval
- For NEW features/pages: Use Design Master Prompt first (see RULE #1A)
- For EXISTING features: Present 2-4 implementation options first
- User says "do it" or picks an option → You have permission
- User says "wait" or asks questions → Don't code yet
- Exception: Only write code if user clearly says "implement", "build", "code it"

### **RULE #1A: DESIGN MASTER PROMPT (FOR NEW FEATURES/PAGES)**
- Read `docs/ai-workflow/DESIGN-MASTER-PROMPT-ANALYSIS.md` first
- Before writing ANY code for new pages/features, ask:
  ```
  "Would you like me to:
   A) Design this first using Design Master Prompt v3.0 (ensures Galaxy-Swan theme)
   B) Use existing SwanStudios components (faster, no custom design)
   C) Skip design and code directly (not recommended)

   Recommended: Option A for new pages, Option B for small features"
  ```
- If user picks Option A: Output Design JSON first, wait for approval, THEN code
- If user picks Option B: Use existing components, no custom design needed
- If user picks Option C: Warn about generic design risk, then proceed if they insist
- See AI Village Handbook Section 6.6 for full Build Gate process

### **RULE #1B: CHECK FOR EXISTING FILES BEFORE CREATING NEW ONES**
- Before creating a new .md file, search for similar files first
- Use Glob or Grep to find existing documentation on the topic
- If similar file exists, ask user:
  ```
  "I found an existing file: [filename]
   Would you like me to:
   A) Update/enhance the existing file
   B) Create a new consolidated version (v3.0)
   C) Create a separate file (explain why it's not a duplicate)

   Recommended: Option A or B to avoid duplicates"
  ```
- Only create new files after user explicitly approves
- This prevents duplicate design master prompts, overlapping docs, etc.

### **RULE #2: NO MONOLITHIC FILES**
- Max 500 lines (docs)
- Max 300 lines (components)
- Max 400 lines (services)
- If exceeding: Split into multiple focused files
- Present split strategy to user before implementing

### **RULE #3: LOCK FILES YOU'RE EDITING**
- Update `docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/CURRENT-TASK.md`
- Add your files to "LOCKED FILES" section
- Format: `filename.ts - Locked by [AI Name] - [Task]`
- Unlock when done

### **RULE #4: UPDATE YOUR STATUS**
- Update your status file when starting work
- Change status to 🟢 ACTIVE
- List files you're editing
- When done: Change to ✅ COMPLETE
- Add to "COMPLETED TODAY" section

### **RULE #5: PHASE 0 DESIGN REVIEW (For New Features)**
- ALL new features require 5 AI approvals before code
- Check `docs/ai-workflow/PHASE-0-REGISTRY.md`
- If no Phase 0 exists, create one first
- Use templates in `docs/ai-workflow/`

### **RULE #6: 7-CHECKPOINT PIPELINE (For Code Changes)**
```
1. Roo Code → Code quality review
2. Gemini → Logic correctness review
3. Claude Desktop → Security review (OWASP ASVS)
4. ChatGPT-5 → Testing coverage review
5. Codex/GPT-4 → Performance review
6. Claude Code → Integration review
7. User → Final approval
```
- Code must pass ALL checkpoints before Git push
- If any checkpoint fails: Fix and restart from that checkpoint

6. **Coordinate with MinMax v2** for multi-AI consensus and final approval

**WHEN TO USE YOUR SKILLS:**
✅ **Use Kilo Code for:**
- Boot camp class programming (50-min classes)
- Circuit design and board layout (8-board system)
- Adaptive difficulty planning (Easy/Hard versions)
- Equipment flow optimization
- Preferred workout library analysis (AI learning Sean's style)
- Group training coordination (8-16 participants)

❌ **Don't use Kilo Code for:**
- Personal training (1-on-1 client programming - use Claude Code instead)
- SwanStudios website development (use primary AI Village)
- Non-training data or business operations

**BOARD DISPLAY TEMPLATE (4-exercise example):**
```
BOARD 1: LOWER BODY POWER
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ A1: Goblet Squat - 30 lbs - 3x12      │
│ A2: Kettlebell Swings - 25 lbs - 3x15 │
│ A3: Jump Squats - BW - 3x10           │
│ A4: Walking Lunges - 20 lbs - 3x12    │
│                                         │
│ EASY: 20 lbs squat, no jump, no weight │
│ HARD: 50 lbs squat + pulse 3x, 40 lbs  │
│                                         │
│ Time: 45 sec work, 10 sec transition   │
│ Rest: 60 seconds after all 4 exercises │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**PREFERRED WORKOUT LIBRARY LEARNING:**
Track exercise usage over 10+ classes to learn Sean's signature style:
- TRX Rows (used in 9/10 classes) → "Coach's #1 choice"
- Kettlebell Swings (used in 8/10 classes) → "High energy finisher"
- Battle Rope Intervals (used in 8/10 classes) → "Crowd favorite"
- Medicine Ball Slams (used in 7/10 classes) → "Power development"
- Air Bike Sprints (used in 6/10 classes) → "Cardio integration"

**UNIFIED INTERFACE:**
Boot camp classes are built within the SwanStudios admin dashboard (same app as personal training).
Single-page toggle between personal training and boot camp modes.

**FIRST QUESTION TO USER:**
```
I'm Kilo Code, Boot Camp Specialist (Coach Cortex v3.1).

I've read current status:
✅ Boot camp system integration complete (v3.1)
✅ 8-board system documented (typically 4-5 boards, 2-6 exercises per board, flexible combinations)
✅ Adaptive difficulty standards set (Easy/Hard versions)
✅ Equipment inventory confirmed (air bikes, spin bikes, rowers, etc.)
✅ Rest timing: 10 sec between exercises, 60 sec after board completion

I specialize in:
- 50-minute boot camp class programming
- Board-based circuit design (flexible: 4 boards × 4-6 exercises OR 5 boards × 3-4 exercises, etc.)
- Equipment flow optimization (minimize transitions)
- Preferred workout library learning (AI learns your style)

What class should I design?
- Day/time? (e.g., Tuesday 6pm)
- Number of participants? (8-16 typical)
- Age range? (16-77 years)
- Focus area? (upper body, lower body, full body, HIIT)

I'll generate a complete class with Easy/Hard versions and coordinate with other AIs for safety review.
```

## 📋 CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT

### **SwanStudios Status**
- **Phase:** Post-MUI Elimination → M0 Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- **Current Work:** Getting production site live + MUI elimination
- **Progress:** ~80-90% feature complete, modernizing existing code
- **Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, styled-components, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Render
- **Live Site:** https://sswanstudios.com

### **Recent Accomplishments (Today)**
- ✅ Fixed Render build errors
- ✅ Added missing hooks (useTable.ts, useForm.ts)
- ✅ Added UI Kit components (11 files)
- ✅ Created AI-HANDOFF coordination system
- ⏳ Render building now (commit: 34878459)

### **Current Mission**
**MUI Elimination:**
- Convert ~218 files from Material-UI → styled-components
- Use UI Kit: `frontend/src/components/ui-kit/`
- Follow Component Documentation Standards (7 files per component)
- Galaxy-Swan theme (cosmic gradients, glass surfaces, swan motifs)
- Target: Remove MUI packages permanently

## 🔄 YOUR WORKFLOW (EVERY AI FOLLOWS THIS)

### **Step 1: Read Files (30 seconds)**
1. Read `CURRENT-TASK.md` (where are we now?)
2. Read `HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md` (the rules)
3. Read your status file (your current work)
4. Check other AI status files (any conflicts?)

### **Step 2: Report Back**
```
"I'm [AI Name], [Your Role].

✅ Onboarded - Read coordination files
✅ Current Phase: [from CURRENT-TASK.md]
✅ My Status: [from your status file]
✅ Other AIs: [who's active]
✅ Locked Files: [any locked files]
✅ Rules understood: No code without permission, no monoliths, lock files

I'm ready! What should I work on?"
```

### **Step 3: User Assigns Task**
User says: "Fix bug X" or "Build feature Y"

### **Step 4: Analyze (DON'T CODE YET!)**
- Check CURRENT-TASK.md for conflicts
- Check if files are locked
- Identify root cause
- Draft 2-4 solution options

### **Step 5: Present Options**
```
"I see [X] ways to solve this:

Option A: [Approach]
  Changes: [file list]
  Pros: [benefits]
  Cons: [drawbacks]
  Time: [estimate]

Option B: [Approach]
  Changes: [file list]
  Pros: [benefits]
  Cons: [drawbacks]
  Time: [estimate]

I recommend Option A because [reason].

Which do you prefer?"
```

### **Step 6: Wait for Permission**
- User picks option → You have permission
- User asks questions → Answer them
- User says "wait" → Don't proceed

### **Step 7: Lock & Implement**
1. Update CURRENT-TASK.md (add to LOCKED FILES)
2. Update your status file (Status: 🟢 ACTIVE)
3. Implement approved solution
4. Keep files under size limits
5. Follow coding standards

### **Step 8: Complete & Unlock**
1. Unlock files in CURRENT-TASK.md
2. Update your status file (Status: ✅ COMPLETE)
3. Add to "COMPLETED TODAY" section
4. If passing work to another AI, update their status file

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO THESE)

### **❌ The Cowboy Coder**
```
❌ BAD: User says "fix bug" → You immediately edit files

✅ GOOD: User says "fix bug" → You:
  1. Read CURRENT-TASK.md
  2. Analyze root cause
  3. Present 3 options with pros/cons
  4. Wait for user to choose
  5. Lock files
  6. Implement
  7. Unlock and update status
```

### **❌ The Monolith Maker**
```
❌ BAD: Create 2000-line UserManagement.tsx

✅ GOOD: Split into:
  - UserManagementContainer.tsx (100 lines)
  - UserTable.tsx (200 lines)
  - UserForm.tsx (150 lines)
  - userManagement.types.ts (80 lines)
```

### **❌ The Lone Wolf**
```
❌ BAD: Edit files without checking other AIs

✅ GOOD:
  - Check CURRENT-TASK.md for locked files
  - Read other AI status files
  - Coordinate via status file updates
```

### **❌ The Assumption Maker**
```
❌ BAD: Assume approach X and implement

✅ GOOD: Present options A, B, C and let user choose
```

## 🎯 PHASE 0 vs AI-HANDOFF: WHEN TO USE EACH

### **Use PHASE 0 SYSTEM for:**
- ✅ New features (require 5 AI approvals)
- ✅ Architecture changes
- ✅ Major refactors
- ✅ Breaking changes
- ✅ New components/systems

**Process:**
1. Create Phase 0 packet (use templates)
2. Get 5 AI approvals
3. Document in PHASE-0-REGISTRY.md
4. Then use AI-HANDOFF for implementation

### **Use AI-HANDOFF SYSTEM for:**
- ✅ Day-to-day coordination
- ✅ Knowing current status
- ✅ Avoiding file conflicts
- ✅ Tracking who's working on what
- ✅ Preventing monolithic files
- ✅ Quick status updates

**Both systems work together:**
- Phase 0 = Design approval
- AI-HANDOFF = Implementation coordination
