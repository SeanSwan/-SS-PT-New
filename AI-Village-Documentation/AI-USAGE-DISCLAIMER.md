## 2. Implementation Plan

This disclaimer must be implemented in the following ways to ensure user acknowledgment and limit liability.

### **A. First-Use Modal (Consent Capture)**

- **Trigger**: The first time a user (any role) attempts to access an AI-powered feature (e.g., clicks "Generate Workout").
- **UI**: A blocking modal displaying the full disclaimer text.
- **Action**: The modal must contain a checkbox and an "I Understand and Agree" button.
  - `[ ] I have read, understood, and agree to the AI Usage Disclaimer and Assumption of Risk.`
- **Logic**: The "I Understand and Agree" button is disabled until the checkbox is ticked.
- **Storage**: Upon agreement, a record must be created in a `user_consents` table, logging the `user_id`, `consent_type: 'ai_usage'`, `version: '1.0'`, and a `timestamp`. This creates an auditable record of consent.
- **Behavior**: Once consent is given, the modal should not appear again for that user unless the disclaimer version is updated.

### **B. Footer on AI-Generated Content**

- **Trigger**: Any content generated by an AI feature (e.g., a workout plan PDF, a meal plan displayed on screen).
- **UI**: A small, non-intrusive footer at the bottom of the content.
- **Text**: `AI-Generated Content. Not medical advice. Use at your own risk. See full disclaimer.` The "full disclaimer" should be a link to a page containing the disclaimer text.

### **C. Terms of Service Update**

- **Action**: The full text of this disclaimer must be incorporated into the main SwanStudios Terms of Service document.
- **Location**: A new section titled "AI-Generated Content and Limitation of Liability".
