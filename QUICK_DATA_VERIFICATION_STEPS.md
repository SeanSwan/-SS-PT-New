# üîç QUICK DATA VERIFICATION GUIDE
## How to verify your admin dashboard shows real, accurate data

### üöÄ **Step 1: Deploy the New Analytics System**
```bash
# Push the new real Stripe analytics to production
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Real Stripe analytics with data verification"
git push origin main

# Wait for Render deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
```

### üìä **Step 2: Compare with Stripe Dashboard**

**Open TWO browser tabs:**

**Tab 1: Your Stripe Dashboard**
- Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
- Set date range: "Last 30 days"  
- Note the **"Gross volume"** amount

**Tab 2: Your SwanStudios Admin Dashboard**
- Go to: https://sswanstudios.com/dashboard/admin
- Login with admin credentials
- Navigate to **Revenue Analytics**
- Note the **"Total Revenue"** amount

**‚úÖ ACCURACY CHECK:**
- These two numbers should match within $1
- If they match = **Your data is accurate! üéâ**
- If they don't match = Continue to troubleshooting below

### üîß **Step 3: Use Built-in Verification Tools**

**In your admin dashboard, look for the "Data Verification Center" panel:**

1. **Click "Compare with Stripe"**
   - This will show you exact comparison between sources
   - Look for `"revenue_match": true` in the results

2. **Click "Show Data Sources"**  
   - Confirms where each number comes from
   - Verifies Stripe API connection status

3. **Click "Test Calculations"**
   - Shows step-by-step how revenue is calculated
   - Helps identify any calculation errors

4. **Click "Refresh All Data"**
   - Forces fresh data from Stripe API
   - Compares before/after to check for updates

### üéØ **Step 4: Quick Terminal Test (Optional)**
```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x verify-data-accuracy.sh

# Run verification test
./verify-data-accuracy.sh production

# Check the generated report
cat data_verification_report.txt
```

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If revenue doesn't match Stripe:**

**Check 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Verify you're using the right Stripe keys
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | head -c 20
# Should start with sk_live_ for production
```

**Check 2: Date Range & Timezone**
- Stripe uses UTC timezone
- Your dashboard might use local timezone
- Try different time ranges (7 days, 24 hours)

**Check 3: Test vs Live Mode**
- Ensure you're comparing the same environment
- Check if you're accidentally using test data

**Check 4: Webhook Configuration**
- Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- Verify webhook is pointing to: `https://sswanstudios.com/webhooks/stripe`
- Check webhook events include: `checkout.session.completed`

### **If you see "Stripe client not available" errors:**

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# In your Render dashboard, verify these environment variables exist:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Test Connection:**
```bash
# SSH into your server and test Stripe
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \
  -u sk_live_YOUR_KEY: \
  -d limit=1
```
