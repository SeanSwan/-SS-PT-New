/**
 * EMERGENCY CORRUPTION FIX - BUILD FAILURE RESOLUTION
 * ===================================================
 * 
 * Fixed critical file corruption that was causing Render build failures
 * 
 * ISSUE DETECTED:
 * ==============
 * 
 * ❌ File: frontend/src/services/clientTrainerAssignmentService.ts
 * ❌ Problem: File contained literal `\n` characters instead of actual newlines
 * ❌ Error: [vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 1 error: Syntax error "n"
 * ❌ Impact: Complete build failure on Render deployment
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * ===========
 * 
 * This is the exact type of file corruption mentioned in the original hand-off report:
 * "prevent errors like this example: can see the deployment failed due to a syntax 
 * error in the RealTimeSignupMonitoring.tsx file. The file appears to have corrupted 
 * line endings with literal \n characters instead of actual newlines."
 * 
 * EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED:
 * ======================
 * 
 * ✅ STEP 1: Identified corrupted file with literal `\n` characters
 * ✅ STEP 2: Completely rewrote file with proper newline formatting  
 * ✅ STEP 3: Preserved all original functionality and logic
 * ✅ STEP 4: Scanned entire codebase - no other corrupted files found
 * ✅ STEP 5: Verified clean syntax and proper TypeScript formatting
 * 
 * FILE RECOVERY STATUS:
 * =====================
 * 
 * ✅ clientTrainerAssignmentService.ts: FIXED - Proper newlines restored
 * ✅ All other files: VERIFIED CLEAN - No corruption detected
 * ✅ Build compatibility: RESTORED - Should deploy successfully on Render
 * 
 * PREVENTION MEASURES:
 * ====================
 * 
 * Moving forward, all file operations will be monitored for literal `\n` corruption
 * to prevent this type of build failure from occurring again.
 * 
 * The Foundry Verification process will include specific checks for:
 * - Literal `\n` character detection
 * - Proper newline formatting validation
 * - Build syntax verification
 * 
 * This emergency fix should restore successful deployment capability.
