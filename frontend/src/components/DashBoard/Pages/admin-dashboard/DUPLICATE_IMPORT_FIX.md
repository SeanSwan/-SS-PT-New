# ðŸŽ¯ DUPLICATE IMPORT RESOLUTION

## âœ… FIXED: LineChart Import Conflict

### Problem:
- `LineChart` was imported from both `lucide-react` (icon) and `recharts` (chart component)
- This caused a "Duplicate declaration" compilation error

### Solution:
- Renamed icon import: `LineChart as LineChartIcon` from lucide-react
- Kept chart import: `LineChart` from recharts unchanged

### Files Modified:
- `admin-dashboard-view.tsx` - Fixed duplicate import
