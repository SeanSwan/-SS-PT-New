## üîÑ MIGRATION GUIDE

### **STEP 1: BACKUP ORIGINAL FILES**
```bash
# Navigate to admin-sessions directory
cd frontend/src/components/DashBoard/Pages/admin-sessions

# Backup original files
mv enhanced-admin-sessions-view.tsx enhanced-admin-sessions-view.tsx.backup
```

### **STEP 2: DEPLOY OPTIMIZED VERSION**
```bash
# Copy optimized main component
cp optimized/EnhancedAdminSessionsView-optimized.tsx enhanced-admin-sessions-view.tsx

# Or use import redirect approach
```

### **STEP 3: UPDATE IMPORTS (RECOMMENDED)**
```typescript
// OLD IMPORT
import EnhancedAdminSessionsView from './enhanced-admin-sessions-view';

// NEW IMPORT (with redirect)
import { EnhancedAdminSessionsViewOptimized as EnhancedAdminSessionsView } from './optimized';
```

### **STEP 4: VERIFY INTEGRATION**
1. Test admin sessions page loads correctly
2. Verify all functionality works (view, edit, create sessions)
3. Test responsive design on mobile
4. Validate accessibility with screen reader
5. Check performance with browser dev tools
