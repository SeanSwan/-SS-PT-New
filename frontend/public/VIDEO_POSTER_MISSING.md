# Placeholder for video-poster.jpg
# This file should be replaced with an actual poster image for videos
# The 404 error occurs because a component is trying to load /video-poster.jpg
# 
# SOLUTION: Either:
# 1. Add an actual video-poster.jpg file to frontend/public/
# 2. Update the component to use an existing image like Logo.png
# 3. Remove the poster attribute from video elements if not needed
#
# For now, components should use /Logo.png as the poster image instead

MISSING_FILE: video-poster.jpg
SOLUTION: Use /Logo.png or /swan-tile.png as poster image
COMPONENT_UPDATE_NEEDED: Check video elements for poster="/video-poster.jpg"
