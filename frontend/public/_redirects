# SPA redirect rules for SwanStudios (Render Static Site)
# This file tells Render to serve index.html for all routes that don't match static files

# All routes should serve the React app (SPA fallback)
# This enables client-side routing - when user refreshes on /store, /about, etc.
# the server serves index.html and React Router handles the routing
/*    /index.html   200
