# URGENT BUILD FIX: RefreshCw Import Error

## Issue
Deployment failing with error:
```
"Refresh" is not exported by "node_modules/lucide-react/dist/esm/lucide-react.js"
```

## Root Cause
The lucide-react library doesn't export an icon named `Refresh` - it should be `RefreshCw`.

## Fix Applied
âœ… **UniversalMasterSchedule.tsx** - Line 87 import fixed
- Changed: `Refresh,` 
- To: `RefreshCw, // Fixed import - was causing build error`

## Deployment Command
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "URGENT FIX: Replace Refresh with RefreshCw import in UniversalMasterSchedule.tsx - resolves build error" && git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- Build should succeed
- Admin dashboard should load correctly
- Universal Master Schedule component should work properly

## Verification
After deployment, verify:
1. Build completes successfully
2. Admin dashboard loads without errors
3. Universal Master Schedule is accessible
4. All RefreshCw icons display correctly

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/UniversalMasterSchedule/UniversalMasterSchedule.tsx`

## Notes
- This was a critical build-breaking error
- The fix ensures correct lucide-react icon import
- No functional changes to the component
