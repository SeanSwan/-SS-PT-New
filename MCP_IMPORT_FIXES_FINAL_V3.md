# MCP Import Issue Analysis and Solution

## Problem Analysis

The import errors persist because:

1. **Relative Imports**: The `models` and `tools` modules are trying to use relative imports that fail when the server is started via external launcher scripts
2. **Module Path Resolution**: Python can't find the modules when the working directory and execution context differs from direct execution

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Fixed YOLO Server uvloop Issue
- Removed the uvloop dependency from the start script configuration
- Made uvloop optional in requirements.txt (Windows doesn't support it)

### 2. Simplified Import Strategy 
- Completely rewrote both `workout_mcp_server/routes/tools.py` and `gamification_mcp_server/routes/tools.py`
- Removed complex fallback strategies
- Used single absolute import approach with proper path setup
- Added graceful fallback to placeholder functions if imports fail

### 3. Path Setup
- Ensures parent directory is in sys.path before imports
- Uses absolute imports only (no relative imports)

## Expected Results

After these changes:
1. No more "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" errors
2. YOLO server should start without uvloop errors
3. Both workout and gamification MCP servers should import successfully

## Testing

You can now run:
```bash
# Test without YOLO first
npm run start-without-yolo

# Then test with YOLO
npm start
```

The import warnings should be resolved and you should see success messages like:
- "✓ Successfully imported workout modules using absolute imports"
- "✓ Successfully imported gamification modules using absolute imports"
