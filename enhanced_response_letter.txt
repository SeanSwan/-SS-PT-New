Re: Zedrick Turnbough v. Laura Rosales - Response to November 12, 2025 Letter
Your Reference: CA1-82K-TDD

Dear Mr. Fong:

My office represents Laura Rosales, landlord of 728 E. Big Bear Blvd., Unit 2, Big Bear City, CA 92314. This letter responds to your November 12, 2025 correspondence on behalf of Mr. Turnbough. The allegations of habitability defects, harassment, and retaliation are contradicted by the lease, the documented chronology, and your client's own conduct.

1. Lease Obligations and Immediate Breaches
Mr. Turnbough executed a six-month written lease on April 30, 2025, expiring October 31, 2025. The lease and California Civil Code section 1954 required reasonable access for inspections and repairs; the lease also prohibited unapproved animals, required sanitary upkeep, and mandated compliance with applicable law.
- Unauthorized dog: Your client brought a large dog onto the premises without permission, frightening occupants in Unit 1 and violating Section 40. A Notice of Lease Violation issued June 20, 2025 directed removal within 48 hours; noncompliance constitutes a material breach.
- Refused access: Despite multiple 24-hour notices for insurance-required photographs, rodent inspections, repairs, and electrical panel assessments, your client declined entry or failed to respond on May 19, June 1, June 10, August 28, October 5, and October 19, 2025. These events are detailed in Ms. Rosales's timeline (Exhibit A). Obstructing repairs is incompatible with any claim of uninhabitability. See Cal. Civ. Code section 1941.

2. Proper Notices and Service
All required notices were properly served:
- Notice of Lease Violation (June 20, 2025), personally served June 21, 2025.
- Notice of Termination (October 28, 2025), served via certified mail and personal delivery, directing vacancy by the October 31, 2025 lease expiration.
Your client's continued possession after October 31 constitutes a holdover tenancy under Civil Code section 1946 and grounds for unlawful detainer under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161.

3. Habitability and Retaliation Claims Lack Support
- Condition at move-in: A pre-move-in inspection on April 29, 2025 documented the property's condition; the "rodent holes" your client references were absent or inconsistent with those photos (Exhibit B).
- Repair efforts blocked: Ms. Rosales repeatedly scheduled extermination and repairs that your client refused to permit, undermining any assertion that conditions were unaddressed.
- Power interruption: The brief electrical interruption on or about September 15, 2025 coincided with local storms; utility records reflect this (Exhibit C).
- Insurance inspections: Your client's refusal to allow required inspections jeopardized coverage and potential repairs.
Allegations of harassment or retaliation under Civil Code section 1942.2 are unfounded where the landlord sought compliance, access, and even offered assistance to facilitate a voluntary move-out.

4. Settlement and Demand
Ms. Rosales remains willing to resolve this efficiently. Final offer:
- Vacate by [insert date, e.g., December 5, 2025];
- Pay outstanding rent through move-out and holdover damages at $100/day per the lease;
- Reimburse reasonable attorney's fees incurred to date ($2,500);
- In exchange, Ms. Rosales will forbear from pursuing additional damages or costs.
This offer expires five (5) days from the date of this letter.

Absent acceptance, please confirm your client's move-out date within five (5) days. Otherwise, Ms. Rosales will proceed with unlawful detainer, recovery of past-due rent and holdover damages, and attorney's fees under the lease and Civil Code section 1717.

5. Preservation and Communications
Ms. Rosales has instituted a litigation hold on all relevant documents, communications, photos, and inspection records. Please confirm your client has done likewise to avoid spoliation. Direct all future communications to my office; further contact with Ms. Rosales is neither necessary nor appropriate.

Sincerely,
