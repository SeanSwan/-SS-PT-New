❌ ISSUE: UnifiedSessionService constructor accessing models before cache init
✅ FIX: Changed to lazy-loading getters for all model dependencies
🎯 IMPACT: Resolves ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND models cache error
🚀 STATUS: Production deployment should now succeed

Technical details:
- Constructor was calling getSession(), getUser() etc. at import time
- Models cache not initialized yet during module imports
- Changed to lazy getters that initialize models only when first accessed
- Preserves all functionality while fixing initialization order

This hotfix enables Phase 2C admin dashboard to deploy successfully."
