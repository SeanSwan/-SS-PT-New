## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST EVERYTHING IS WORKING**

### **Option 1: Quick API Test**
```bash
# Run this script to test all endpoints:
TEST-API-ENDPOINTS.bat
```

### **Option 2: Manual Browser Test**
1. **Open your frontend**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Log in** with your credentials (Username: `Swanstudios`, Password: `TempPassword123!`)
3. **Go to client dashboard**
4. **Check browser console** (F12) - should be clean!

### **Option 3: Direct API Test**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:10000/health

# Test protected endpoints (should return 401 - auth required)
curl http://localhost:10000/api/dashboard/stats
curl http://localhost:10000/api/notifications
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
- **Console shows:** Clean (no 404 errors)
- **Dashboard loads:** All sections display properly
- **API responses:** 200 (success) or 401 (auth required)
- **WebSocket message:** "polling mode" (not an error!)

### **❌ PROBLEMS TO WATCH FOR:**
- **404 errors:** Route not found (shouldn't happen now)
- **500 errors:** Server error (code issue)
- **Continuous error spam:** Connection issues
