## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING SPECIFIC SCENARIOS

### **Scenario A: Prices Still Show $0 After Login**
```bash
# 1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
# 2. Hard refresh: Ctrl + F5
# 3. Clear localStorage:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();

# 4. Re-run production seeder:
cd backend && npm run production-seed
```

### **Scenario B: Cart Operations Still Fail (500 Errors)**
```bash
# Backend cart routes have been fixed, but if issues persist:
# 1. Check Render backend logs
# 2. Verify user authentication
# 3. Check network tab for exact error details
```

### **Scenario C: Frontend Build Fails**
```bash
# Use our verification tool:
cd frontend
npm run verify-build

# If failures, check for:
# - Missing dependencies: npm install
# - TypeScript errors: npm run lint
# - Build cache issues: npm run clear-cache
```

## 📞 TECHNICAL SUMMARY

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Backend cart routes had field reference errors causing 500s

3. Browser cache was serving stale $0 pricing data
4. Potential database records with null/zero pricing

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. Fixed all backend cart route field references
2. Removed click-to-reveal pricing for authenticated users
3. Enhanced frontend build process with cache busting
4. Provided production database seeder for pricing correction

**Expected Outcome:**
SwanStudios Store will display correct luxury package pricing immediately upon login, with full cart functionality and no 500 errors.

## 🚨 IF PROBLEMS PERSIST

If you continue to see $0 pricing after completing all steps:

1. **Check the debug tool output** - Run `node debug-store-pricing.mjs`
2. **Verify your login status** - Ensure you're logged in as admin/user
3. **Check browser developer tools** - Look for JavaScript errors
4. **Contact support** - Provide debug tool output and browser console logs

The fixes implemented address all known causes of the $0 pricing issue. The most likely remaining issue would be cached data in the browser.
