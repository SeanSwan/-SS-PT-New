- Build system couldn't resolve the directory import

### **Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Created index.js** in services/gamification/ directory
- ✅ **Proper exports** from gamification-service.js
- ✅ **File structure** now matches import expectations
- ✅ **Build path resolved** for gamification services

### **Code Added:**
```javascript
// services/gamification/index.js
export { default } from './gamification-service.js';
export * from './gamification-service.js';
```
