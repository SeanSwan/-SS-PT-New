## Overview

This framework ensures **ethical, legal, and privacy-compliant** handling of all client data in the SwanStudios Personal Training System. It provides clear protocols for obtaining, storing, managing, and honoring client consent across all data types and use cases.

### Why This Matters
- **Legal Protection:** Protects SwanStudios from liability
- **Client Trust:** Demonstrates respect for client autonomy
- **Privacy Compliance:** Meets GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA requirements
- **Ethical Standards:** Upholds professional trainer-client relationships
- **Data Governance:** Establishes clear data ownership and usage rights

### Core Principles
1. **Informed Consent:** Clients understand what they're consenting to
2. **Granular Control:** Clients can consent to specific uses, not just "all or nothing"
3. **Easy Withdrawal:** Clients can withdraw consent at any time
4. **Transparent Usage:** Clients know how their data is being used
5. **Minimal Collection:** Only collect data necessary for training

## HIPAA Compliance

### When HIPAA Applies
HIPAA applies to personal trainers ONLY if you are a **Covered Entity** or **Business Associate**:
- **Covered Entity:** Healthcare providers who transmit health info electronically (e.g., billing insurance)
- **Business Associate:** Work with a covered entity and handle PHI on their behalf

**Most personal trainers do NOT fall under HIPAA.**

However, following HIPAA-like standards is **best practice** and provides strong legal protection.

### HIPAA-Like Standards for Personal Trainers

#### 1. Minimum Necessary Rule
- Collect only the health information necessary for training
- Don't ask for full medical records if not needed
- Example: Ask "Do you have knee pain?" not "Send me your orthopedic surgeon's notes"

#### 2. Use and Disclosure Limitations
- Use health information ONLY for:
  - Designing safe training programs
  - Monitoring progress
  - Coordinating with client's doctor (with consent)
- Do NOT:
  - Share client health info with other clients
  - Discuss client health issues publicly
  - Use health info for marketing without explicit consent

#### 3. Secure Storage
- Encrypt digital health records
- Lock physical files in secure location
- Use password-protected devices
- No health info in unencrypted emails or texts

#### 4. Access Controls
- Only trainer has access to client health information
- Log any access by third parties (e.g., if you hire an assistant)
- Client can request access log

#### 5. Breach Notification
- If health data is breached (lost, stolen, hacked):
  - Notify client within 48-72 hours
  - Explain what happened and what you're doing to fix it
  - Offer credit monitoring if SSN or financial info was exposed
  - Document the breach and response

---

## Minor Client Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- **Parental Consent:** Required for all clients under 18
- **Age of Consent:** Varies by state (usually 18, sometimes 16 for medical decisions)
- **Medical Clearance:** STRONGLY recommended for minors, especially under 14

### Special Protections for Minors

#### 1. Parental Involvement
- Parent/guardian must sign all consent forms
- Parent should be present for initial consultation
- Parent receives copies of progress reports
- Parent can access all client data at any time

#### 2. Privacy Considerations
- Adolescents (14-17) may want some privacy from parents
- Balance minor's autonomy with parental rights
- Example: Teen can choose not to share weight with parents, but trainer should encourage transparency

#### 3. Photo/Video Restrictions
- EXTRA caution with minor photos
- Parental consent required for ANY photo/video
- NEVER post minor photos on social media without explicit parental permission
- Consider "no face" policy for minors in marketing

#### 4. AI Coaching Restrictions
- Limit AI coaching for minors under 16
- Parental oversight of AI check-in content
- No unsupervised AI communication with minors

### Sample Minor Consent Addendum
```markdown
## Additional Protections for Minor Client

Client: [Minor Name, Age 15]
Parent/Guardian: [Parent Name]

Special Considerations:
- Parent will receive weekly progress reports via email
- Parent has access to all training data and communications
- AI check-ins will CC parent on all messages
- NO photos will be taken without parent present
- NO marketing use of photos under any circumstances
- Parent can terminate training at any time

## Data Retention Policies

### Retention Periods

| Data Type | Retention Period | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|

| Liability waivers | 7 years after last service | Legal protection |
| Payment records | 7 years | Tax/accounting requirements |
| Training programs | 3 years after last service | Professional records |
| Progress photos | Until client requests deletion | Client property |
| Medical information | 3 years after last service | Professional records |
| Email/text communications | 1 year | Business records |
| AI coaching data | Until client requests deletion | Service provision |

### Retention Workflow

**Active Client:**
- Retain all data for duration of client relationship
- Regular backups
- Quarterly consent reviews

**Inactive Client (No sessions in 6+ months):**
- Send email: "We haven't trained in 6 months. Do you want to keep your data active or delete it?"
- If no response in 30 days, move to "Inactive Archive"
- Retain consent forms and legal docs for 7 years
- Delete progress photos and non-essential data after 3 years

**Deleted Account:**
- Delete all training data
- Retain ONLY: consent forms, waivers, payment records
- Archive in "Legal Archive" folder
- Delete after 7 years

---

## AI Coaching Consent

### Specific AI Disclosures

Clients must be informed of:
1. **What AI does:** "AI sends daily check-in messages and analyzes your progress data"
2. **AI limitations:** "AI cannot diagnose injuries or medical conditions"
3. **Human oversight:** "All AI recommendations are reviewed by your human trainer"
4. **Third-party processing:** "Your data may be processed by OpenAI (ChatGPT API)"
5. **Data privacy:** "AI providers have strict data privacy agreements"
6. **Opt-out:** "You can opt out of AI coaching at any time"

### AI Data Processing Agreement

When using third-party AI services (OpenAI, etc.), ensure:
- AI provider has Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
- AI provider does NOT use client data to train models (OpenAI API has this protection)
- AI provider encrypts data in transit and at rest
- AI provider deletes data after processing (if possible)

### AI Consent Granularity

Allow clients to consent to specific AI features:
- [ ] Daily text check-ins
- [ ] Voice check-ins
- [ ] AI analysis of progress photos
- [ ] AI workout adjustments
- [ ] AI nutrition insights
- [ ] AI pain tracking

Client can mix and match (e.g., "Yes to text check-ins, no to photo analysis").

### Photography Best Practices

#### Before Taking Photos

- [ ] Offer private space to change
- [ ] Ask "Are you comfortable with this?"

#### During Photo Session
- [ ] Use neutral, private location

- [ ] Delete from camera/phone after transfer
- [ ] Do NOT show photos to other clients
- [ ] Label files clearly: "[ClientName]-Progress-[Date].jpg"

### Marketing Use Workflow

**Before Posting:**
1. Get explicit written consent for that specific photo
2. Show client the exact photo and caption you plan to use
3. Allow client to review and approve
4. Document approval: "Client approved via email on [date]"

**Sample Marketing Consent Request:**
```
Subject: Permission to Share Your Amazing Progress!

Hi [Client],

You've made incredible progress and I'd love to share your success story to
inspire others! I'm thinking of posting the attached before/after photos on
Instagram with this caption:

"[Client First Name] lost 25 lbs and gained confidence! 💪 So proud of this
transformation. #SwanStudios #TransformationTuesday"

Are you comfortable with me posting this? You can say no, no hard feelings!

If yes, please reply "I approve" and I'll give you credit (or keep you
anonymous if you prefer).

Thanks!
[Trainer Name]
```

## FAQs

### Q: What if a client verbally consents but won't sign a form?
**A:** Verbal consent is better than nothing, but not legally strong. Document it:
- Email follow-up: "Thanks for agreeing to [X] during our session today. Reply to confirm."
- Note in client file: "Client verbally consented to [X] on [date]."
- Best practice: Explain WHY the signature protects both of you and gently encourage signing.

### Q: Can I record client workouts for form analysis without consent?
**A:** NO. Always get consent before recording video, even for form analysis. Many states require two-party consent for recording.

### Q: What if a client requests deletion but owes money?
**A:** You can retain records necessary for the business dispute (invoices, payment history) but should still delete training data per their request. Consult a lawyer if unsure.

### Q: Do I need consent to send workout reminders via text?
**A:** Yes. Obtain consent for SMS communication. Include option to opt out (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe"). Comply with TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act).

### Q: What if I want to use a client's transformation for a case study?
**A:** Get explicit written consent that specifies:
- What data will be shared (photos, story, metrics)
- Where it will be published (website, ebook, conference presentation)
- Whether client will be identified or anonymous
- Client's right to revoke consent

### Q: How do I handle consent for clients who don't speak English well?
**A:** Provide consent forms in client's native language (use professional translation service). Use interpreter during consent discussion if needed. Document: "Consent forms provided in [language] and reviewed with interpreter."
