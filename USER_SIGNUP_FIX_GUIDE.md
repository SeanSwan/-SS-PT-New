# User Signup Fix Guide

This guide explains the changes made to fix the user registration functionality in the SwanStudios application.

## Issues Fixed

The signup process was failing due to several validation errors:

1. **Password Validation**:
   - Added comprehensive password validation to ensure it meets requirements:
     - At least 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character

2. **Fitness Goal Format**:
   - Changed from text input to dropdown select
   - Only allows valid options: weight-loss, muscle-gain, endurance, flexibility, general-fitness, sports-specific, other

3. **Training Experience Format**:
   - Changed from text input to dropdown select
   - Only allows valid options: beginner, intermediate, advanced, professional

4. **Emergency Contact Format**:
   - Split into separate name and phone fields
   - Combines the values into a single string for backend compatibility
   - Fixed validation error by modifying the backend validation to accept a string

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Added SelectField Component

Added a styled dropdown component to ensure users can only select valid options for fitness goal and training experience.

### 2. Enhanced Form Validation

Improved validation in the handleSubmit function to check:
- Password complexity requirements
- Valid fitness goal selection
- Valid training experience selection

### 3. Fixed Emergency Contact Format

- Split the emergency contact field into two fields: name and phone
- Modified code to combine these into a single string
- Updated backend validation to accept a string instead of an object
- Handles edge cases when only one field is filled

### 4. Added User Guidance

- Added password requirement hints under the password field
- Provided clear dropdown options for fitness goal and training experience

## How to Test

1. Start your server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. Navigate to the signup page

3. Fill out the form with valid data:
   - Use a strong password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Select fitness goal from the dropdown
   - Select training experience from the dropdown
   - Fill both emergency contact name and phone fields

4. Submit the form

5. You should be redirected to the login page with a success message

## Known Limitations

1. The backend validation is quite strict. If you need to modify the validation rules, check:
   - `/backend/middleware/validationMiddleware.mjs` for the validation rules
   - `/backend/models/User.mjs` for the schema definition

2. The emergency contact is now formatted as a string in the format "Name Phone".

## Future Improvements

1. Add client-side validation messages for each field before submission
2. Add a password strength meter to give users visual feedback
3. Implement a multi-step registration process for better user experience

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the registration form submits data in the correct format expected by the backend validation middleware. The signup process should now work correctly in both local and production environments.
