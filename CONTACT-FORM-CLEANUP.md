## üóëÔ∏è CONTACT FORM CLEANUP SUMMARY

### Files Removed (Old/Obsolete):
- `ContactForm.tsx` - Basic form component (replaced by EnhancedContactPage)
- `ContactPage.tsx` - Wrapper that used old ContactForm 
- `AdditionalInfo.tsx` - Simple social links (EnhancedContactPage has better social integration)

### Files Kept (Production):
- `EnhancedContactPage.tsx` - Premium contact form with real API integration ‚úÖ
- `index.tsx` - Correctly exports EnhancedContactPage ‚úÖ

### Reason for Cleanup:
The EnhancedContactPage provides all functionality in a single, premium component:
- Real API integration with backend
- Beautiful glass morphism UI
- Contact information cards  
- FAQ section
- Professional social media integration
- Material-UI form fields
- Comprehensive error handling
- Premium animations and effects

The old files were redundant and caused confusion.
