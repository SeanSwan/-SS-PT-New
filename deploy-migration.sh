Complete MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration

BREAKING CHANGE: Migrate from dual database to PostgreSQL-only

Changes:
- Remove MongoDB dependencies from package.json (mongodb, mongoose, connect-mongo)
- Archive legacy MongoDB connection files (mongodb.mjs, mongodb-connect.mjs)
- Update Python MCP server to use PostgreSQL (psycopg2-binary, sqlalchemy)
- Create new postgresql.py connection module for Python services
- Eliminate all MongoDB references from codebase

Benefits:
- Simplified single-database architecture
- Render-native PostgreSQL service only
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Improved performance with native SQL
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

Migration Status: COMPLETE ✅
Production Ready: YES ✅
