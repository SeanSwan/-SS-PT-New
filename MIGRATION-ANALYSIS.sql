-- MIGRATION ANALYSIS - WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
-- ===============================================
-- Based on examination of 20250528140000-fix-uuid-integer-mismatch.cjs

-- THE MIGRATION ATTEMPTS TO:
-- 1. Convert users.id from UUID to INTEGER (by recreating the entire table)
-- 2. Restore user data with new INTEGER IDs  
-- 3. Convert sessions foreign key columns using queryInterface.changeColumn()

-- THE PROBLEM:
-- The migration uses this pattern:
/*
await queryInterface.changeColumn('sessions', 'userId', {
  type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
  allowNull: true,
  references: {
    model: 'users',
    key: 'id'
  }
});
*/

-- This AUTOMATICALLY tries to create a foreign key constraint!
-- But if sessions.userId contains UUID data that can't be converted to INTEGER,
-- or if the conversion fails silently, the foreign key creation will fail.

-- LIKELY SCENARIOS:
-- A) sessions.userId contains actual UUID values that can't be cast to INTEGER
-- B) The changeColumn conversion is failing silently but migration continues
-- C) Old foreign key constraints are still present and interfering

-- DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
-- 1. What is the actual current data type of users.id?
-- 2. What is the actual current data type of sessions.userId?  
-- 3. What actual data is in sessions.userId? (UUIDs? NULLs? Something else?)
-- 4. Are there existing foreign key constraints that need to be dropped first?

-- THE DIAGNOSTIC QUERIES BELOW WILL ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS:
