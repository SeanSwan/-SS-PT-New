# MCP Import Issue Resolution - Final Fix V5 (Indentation Corrected)

## Issue Resolved: Python Indentation Error

After implementing the import fixes, there was a **Python IndentationError** in `workout_mcp_server/models/__init__.py` at line 43:

```
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

### Root Cause
The `except ImportError as e:` line had an extra leading space that didn't align with the corresponding `try:` statement.

### Fix Applied
Corrected the indentation by removing the extra space from line 43:

```python
# Before (incorrect):
 except ImportError as e:

# After (correct):
except ImportError as e:
```

### All Fixed Files Now Include:

✅ **Workout MCP Server**:
- `models/__init__.py` - Fixed (indentation corrected)
- `tools/__init__.py` - Fixed

✅ **Gamification MCP Server**:
- `models/__init__.py` - Fixed (no indentation issues)
- `tools/__init__.py` - Fixed

## Import Strategy Summary

Each file now uses this robust approach:

1. **Path Setup**: Ensure parent directory in `sys.path`
2. **Primary**: Absolute imports (`from models.X import ...`)
3. **Fallback**: Relative imports (`from .X import ...`)
4. **Safety**: Placeholder classes/functions if all imports fail

## Expected Results After Fix

You should now see:

✅ **No syntax/indentation errors**
✅ **No relative import warnings**
✅ **Clean server startup** with success messages like:
- "Successfully imported workout modules using absolute imports"
- "Successfully imported gamification modules using absolute imports"

## Testing

Run the test command again:

```bash
npm run start-without-yolo
```

The systems should now start without any import errors or syntax issues.

## Next Steps

Once confirmed working:
1. Test full system with: `npm start`
2. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix MCP imports with corrected indentation"`

The MCP servers should now initialize properly, enabling full SwanStudios platform functionality.
