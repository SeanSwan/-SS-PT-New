## Known Gaps

These scenarios document known validator limitations. They are excluded from threshold gating but still verified for correctness.

- **adversarial_01**: Phone with spaces (555 123 4567) in exercise notes — PII evasion
  - Rationale: PHONE_PATTERN requires [-.]? separators; spaces bypass the regex. Phone with space separators is not detected.
- **adversarial_03**: Username leetspeak evasion (J0hn Sm1th when userName=John Smith)
  - Rationale: Name regex uses exact word-boundary match; character substitution (leetspeak) bypasses detection.
