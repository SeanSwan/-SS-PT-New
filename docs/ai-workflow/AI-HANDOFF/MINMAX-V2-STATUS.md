## 📋 QUEUED TASKS

**No tasks currently queued.**

---

## 💡 EXPERTISE AREAS

### **1. Strategic UX Analysis**
**When to Use:**
- Analyzing user flows and identifying friction points
- Optimizing feature discovery rates
- Designing embedded gamification moments
- User psychology and motivation triggers
- A/B testing and data-driven optimization

**Example Questions:**
- "Why is feature X only discovered by 30% of users?"
- "How can we increase engagement without being intrusive?"
- "What's the optimal placement for this feature?"

---

### **2. Multi-AI Consensus Building**
**When to Use:**
- Complex questions requiring multiple AI perspectives
- Coordinating parallel implementation work
- Resolving conflicting AI recommendations
- Building weighted consensus with confidence scores

**Example Workflow:**
```
User Question → MinMax v2 analyzes → Routes to specialist AIs →
Each AI provides analysis → MinMax v2 builds consensus →
Returns unified recommendation with confidence score
```

**Escalation Rules:**
- Confidence <75%: Escalate to human review
- Conflicting recommendations: Present all options to user
- Safety concerns: Immediate escalation

---

### **3. Gamification System Design**
**When to Use:**
- Designing point economies and reward systems
- Creating achievement systems
- Building engagement loops
- Social proof features
- Progression systems

**Key Principles:**
- Embedded moments (appear during natural workflow)
- Sustainable economics (prevent inflation)
- Intrinsic motivation (not just points)
- Galaxy-Swan theme integration

---

### **4. Feature Discovery Optimization**
**When to Use:**
- Features with low discovery rates
- Onboarding flow optimization
- Progressive disclosure strategies
- Contextual feature introduction

**Proven Results:**
- 30% → 80% feature discovery rate (gamification)
- Embedded moments vs. separate pages
- Contextual triggers based on user behavior

---

### **5. Personal Training System Optimization**
**When to Use:**
- Client engagement strategies
- Premium service justification ($300-500/session)
- Data capture workflows
- Multi-modal communication (SMS, voice, photo)

**Expertise:**
- Daily check-in protocols
- Photo documentation workflows
- Voice command UX
- Wearable integration
- AI-powered insights presentation
