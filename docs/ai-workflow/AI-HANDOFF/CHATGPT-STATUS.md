3. Added missing Redux hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
4. Added ApiService export alias

**Documentation Created**

## COMPLETED YESTERDAY (2026-01-04)

### **Remediation Tasks (9:29 PM)**
1. Split admin analytics routes into three focused files
2. Split dashboard routes into shared + admin files (moved recent activity)
3. Wired dashboard-tabs config into AdminStellarSidebar
4. Updated backend route registration and architecture doc references

### **Backend Integration Phase 2 (4:17 PM)**
1. Replaced dashboard stats/overview mock data with real aggregates
2. Added admin notifications + client dashboard API routes
3. Registered new routes and aligned notifications API to real data

### **Documentation Remediation (8:02 PM)**
1. Created admin dashboard backend architecture doc with diagrams

### **Dashboard Quick Fixes (1:25 PM)**
1. Fixed admin Messages route wiring in UnifiedAdminDashboardLayout
2. Reordered AdminStellarSidebar for Overview/Schedule priority
3. Added status badges and updated shared tab metadata

### **Render Error Analysis (11:45 AM)**
1. ✅ Analyzed Render build failure
2. ✅ Correctly identified root cause: Missing files in Git repo
3. ✅ Identified untracked files: useTable.ts, useForm.ts
4. ✅ Recommended: Commit missing files to fix Render build

**Analysis Provided:**
- Root cause: Files existed locally but weren't committed
- Evidence: Files untracked in git status
- Solution: Add and commit useTable.ts + useForm.ts
- Additional: Suggested using path aliases to avoid deep imports

**Result:** Analysis was accurate - Claude Code implemented the fix
