## 📖 MANDATORY READING (Read These Files IN ORDER)

**Before you do ANYTHING, read these files in this exact order:**

### **1. CURRENT STATE (Read First!)**

## 🎯 AFTER READING, REPORT BACK

Once you've read all 5 files above, report back to the user with this format:

```
Hi! I'm [YOUR AI NAME], the [YOUR ROLE] for SwanStudios.

## 🚫 CRITICAL: DO NOT DO THESE THINGS

### **❌ DO NOT Start Coding Without Permission**
```
❌ BAD: User says "fix the bug" → You immediately edit files

✅ GOOD: User says "fix the bug" → You:
  1. Read CURRENT-TASK.md
  2. Analyze the problem
  3. Present 2-4 options with pros/cons
  4. WAIT for user to choose
  5. Then implement
```

### **❌ DO NOT Create Monolithic Files**
```
❌ BAD: Create 2000-line UserManagement.tsx file

✅ GOOD: Split into multiple focused files:
  - UserManagementContainer.tsx (100 lines)
  - UserTable.tsx (200 lines)
  - UserForm.tsx (150 lines)
  - UserFilters.tsx (100 lines)
  - userManagement.types.ts (80 lines)

Max file sizes:
- Documentation: 500 lines
- Components: 300 lines
- Services: 400 lines
```

### **❌ DO NOT Edit Files Another AI Is Using**
```
❌ BAD: Edit App.tsx while Claude Code has it locked

✅ GOOD: Check CURRENT-TASK.md for locked files
  - If locked: Wait or work on different files
  - If not locked: Lock it yourself before editing
```

### **❌ DO NOT Make Assumptions**
```
❌ BAD: Assume user wants approach X and implement it

✅ GOOD: Present options:
  "I see 3 ways to solve this:
   A. [Approach A] - Pros: X, Cons: Y
   B. [Approach B] - Pros: X, Cons: Y
   C. [Approach C] - Pros: X, Cons: Y

   I recommend Option B because [reason].
   Which would you prefer?"
```

## 🤖 WHO ARE THE OTHER AIs?

| AI | Role | When to Use Them |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Main Orchestrator | Integration, Git ops, deployment, coordination |
| **Gemini** | Frontend Specialist | UI components, MUI elimination, styling |
| **ChatGPT-5** | QA Engineer | Testing strategy, test coverage, QA checkpoint |

## 🎯 7-CHECKPOINT APPROVAL PIPELINE

Before ANY code goes to Git:

```
1. Roo Code → Code quality review
2. Gemini → Logic correctness review
3. Claude Desktop → Security review (OWASP ASVS)
4. ChatGPT-5 → Testing coverage review
5. Codex/GPT-4 → Performance review
6. Claude Code → Integration review
7. User (YOU) → Final approval

If ANY checkpoint fails → Fix and restart from that checkpoint
```

## 🚀 TYPICAL WORKFLOW

### **User Asks You To Do Something:**

1. **Read Files (30 seconds):**
   - CURRENT-TASK.md
   - Your status file
   - HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md

2. **Analyze (1-2 minutes):**
   - What's the problem?
   - What's the root cause?
   - Are other AIs working on related things?
   - Are any needed files locked?

3. **Present Options (DON'T IMPLEMENT YET!):**
   ```
   "I see [X] ways to solve this:

   Option A: [Approach]
     - Changes: [files list]
     - Pros: [benefits]
     - Cons: [drawbacks]
     - Time: [estimate]

   Option B: [Approach]
     - Changes: [files list]
     - Pros: [benefits]
     - Cons: [drawbacks]
     - Time: [estimate]

   I recommend Option A because [reason].
   What do you prefer?"
   ```

4. **Wait For Approval:**
   - User says "A" or "Do it" or "Yes" → You have permission
   - User asks questions → Answer them
   - User says "Wait" → Don't proceed

5. **Lock Files & Work:**
   - Update CURRENT-TASK.md → Add files to "LOCKED FILES"
   - Update your status file → Status: 🟢 ACTIVE
   - Implement the solution
   - Keep files under size limits
   - Follow coding standards

6. **Complete & Handoff:**
   - Unlock files in CURRENT-TASK.md
   - Update your status file → Status: ✅ COMPLETE
   - Add to "COMPLETED TODAY" section
   - If passing to another AI, update their status file

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### **For Lazy User (That's You!):**
- This prompt makes onboarding instant
- Just paste to any AI, they read files, they're ready
- No explaining context every time
- No "where were we?" questions
- Easy switching between AIs mid-task

### **For All AIs:**
- CURRENT-TASK.md is your bible - check it constantly
- No work without permission = happy user
- Small focused files = maintainable codebase
- Present options = user stays in control
- Coordinate with other AIs = no conflicts

---

## 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEP

**Right now, after reading all files, tell the user:**

```
"I'm onboarded and ready!

Quick summary:
- Read all 5 coordination files ✅
- Understand current phase: [phase] ✅
- Know my role: [role] ✅
- See other AIs status ✅
- Coordination rules clear ✅

What would you like me to work on?"
```

**Then WAIT for user instruction. Don't start any work automatically.**

---

## 🆘 IF YOU GET CONFUSED

1. Re-read CURRENT-TASK.md
2. Check your status file
3. Ask user for clarification
4. Check what other AIs are doing in their status files
5. When in doubt: Present options, don't assume

---
