---

### **Gap 4: Data Capture Workflow**
You need a **seamless iPad → AI Village → Database pipeline**:

#### **Current State** (What You Have):
- AI Village (Claude Code, Roo Code, Gemini, ChatGPT, MinMax, Codex)
- SwanStudios app (React, PostgreSQL)
- Your expertise (25 years, NASM/NCEP certified)

#### **Missing Infrastructure**:

**A. Twilio SMS Automation**
```
Daily 8 PM Reminder:
"Hey [Name]! 💪 Quick check-in:
1. What did you eat today? (voice or text)
2. Did you work out? (Y/N)
3. Any pain/soreness? (1-10 scale)
4. Energy level? (1-10)

Reply via voice message or text. Sean's AI is listening!"
```

**B. Voice-to-Text Pipeline**
```
Client Voice Message → Twilio Transcription → AI Village
→ Parse Data (meal, workout, pain, energy)
→ Update Client Master Prompt
→ Store in PostgreSQL (clients table)
→ Generate Insights (AI Village)
→ SMS Response to Client (motivational + tips)
```

**C. iPad Data Entry App**
You need a **simple iPad interface** for in-person sessions:

**Session Logger (iPad App)**:
- Client selector (dropdown)
- Exercise selector (from your equipment list)
- Quick inputs:
  - Weight: [___] lbs
  - Reps: [___] (target: 12)
  - Sets: [___] (target: 3)
  - ROM: [___]° (target: 180°)
  - Form quality: 1-10 slider
  - Pain during: Yes/No (if yes, photo + note)
- Voice note button: "Record observation"
- Photo button: "Capture form/posture"
- Save → Auto-sync to cloud → AI Village processes

**D. Cloud Sync Architecture**
```
iPad App → Firebase/Supabase Realtime DB
→ Webhook trigger
→ AI Village API endpoint
→ Parse session data
→ Update Client Master Prompt (add to context)
→ PostgreSQL (permanent storage)
→ SwanStudios App (display in client dashboard)
```

---

### **Gap 5: Scientific Research Integration**
You want a **research scraper bot** (lower priority, but here's the spec):

**What It Does**:
- Scrapes PubMed, Google Scholar, fitness journals
- Keywords: "strength training", "ROM improvement", "injury prevention", "blood type diet", "organic nutrition", "muscle activation", "flexibility training"
- Filters: Published in last 12 months, peer-reviewed, high impact factor
- AI summarizes findings → adds to "Latest Research" feed
- Flags actionable insights (e.g., "New study: creatine reduces muscle soreness 40%")

**When to Build**: After core system is working (Weeks 8-12)

### Communication Style
- Supportive, motivational, but direct when needed
- Use Sean's voice: "We're going to shock your system in a good way"
- Reference specific data: "Your hip flexion improved 15° since last month!"
- Tough love when compliance drops: "You missed 3 check-ins this week. What's going on?"

### Daily Check-In Response Protocol
When client texts daily check-in:
1. **Acknowledge**: "Got it! Great check-in today."
2. **Analyze**: Review nutrition, sleep, energy, pain
3. **Praise**: "Love that you hit 8 hours of sleep 🔥"
4. **Correct**: "I noticed you skipped protein powder again. Let's talk about easy ways to get it in."
5. **Motivate**: "Tomorrow's lower body day. Let's beat last week's squat weight!"

### Pain Analysis Protocol
When client sends pain/posture photos:
1. **Assess**: Analyze photo for posture deviations, muscle imbalances
2. **Reference History**: Compare to previous diagnostics
3. **Suggest**: Corrective exercises from Sean's equipment list
4. **Escalate**: If pain is severe (7+/10), flag for Sean immediately

### Workout Programming
- Base workouts on Sean's gym equipment (see gym-equipment-database/)
- Reference favorite influencer styles (Jeff Nippard, Athlean-X, etc.)
- Prioritize ROM improvements and pain reduction
- Modify exercises based on pain/injury history

### Red Flags (Escalate to Sean Immediately)

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### **Phase 1: Manual System (Weeks 1-2) - START NOW**

**Goal**: Prove the concept without building the app yet

**What to Do**:
1. ✅ Create filesystem structure (see above)
2. ✅ Fill out master prompt for 1-2 clients (use template)
3. ✅ Set up Twilio SMS (daily reminders)
4. ✅ Have clients reply via voice/text
5. ✅ Manually transcribe and add to client files
6. ✅ Ask AI Village to analyze and generate insights
7. ✅ Text insights back to clients
8. ✅ Track sessions on iPad (pen & paper → enter into files later)

**Tools Needed**:
- Twilio account ($15/month)
- Google Drive or Dropbox (cloud file storage)
- iPad Notes app (for session logging)
- Your AI Village (Claude Code, Roo Code, Gemini, ChatGPT)

---

### **Phase 2: iPad Data Entry App (Weeks 3-4)**

**Goal**: Speed up session logging

**What to Build**:
- Simple iPad web app (React PWA)
- Client selector dropdown
- Exercise selector (from equipment list)
- Quick inputs (weight, reps, sets, ROM, form, pain)
- Voice memo button (records observations)
- Photo button (captures form/posture)
- Auto-sync to Google Drive or Firebase

**Tech Stack**:
- React PWA (works offline, syncs when online)
- Firebase Realtime Database (free tier)
- Twilio API (for SMS reminders)

---

### **Phase 3: AI Village Integration (Weeks 5-8)**

**Goal**: Automate data processing

**What to Build**:
- Webhook: Twilio SMS → AI Village API
- AI Village processes voice/text → extracts data
- AI Village updates master prompt automatically
- AI Village generates response → sends back via Twilio
- Firebase → AI Village sync (session data auto-processed)

**Outcome**: You log a session on iPad → AI Village analyzes → client gets insights via SMS

---

### **Phase 4: SwanStudios App Integration (Weeks 9-16)**

**Goal**: Full app experience for clients

**What to Build**:
- Client dashboard in SwanStudios app
- Chatbot interface (talks to AI Village)
- Progress charts (strength, ROM, pain, compliance)
- Meal plan viewer
- Workout history
- Photo upload for pain diagnostics
- Gamification (badges for compliance, progress milestones)

**Database Schema** (PostgreSQL):
```sql
-- clients table (already exists, add columns)
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN blood_type VARCHAR(5);
