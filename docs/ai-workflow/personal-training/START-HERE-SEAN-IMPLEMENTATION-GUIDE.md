☐ Generate 1 workout with AI (Claude Code or Roo Code)
```

---

### WEEK 2: AI-Powered Workouts

#### Goal: Stop creating workouts from scratch

```
☐ Monday: Generate Week 2 workouts for all clients (AI Village)
  - Use Claude Code (local, safe with real client data)
  - OR use ChatGPT with generic client profiles (no real names)

☐ Wednesday: Generate bootcamp Leg Day class (AI-powered)
  - Use bootcamp prompt template
  - Print class plan, bring to gym
  - Teach class, note feedback

☐ Friday: Generate bootcamp Upper Body class
  - Iterate on AI prompt (add what worked from Leg Day)
  - Test equipment flow optimizations

☐ Sunday: Weekly review
  - Review all workout logs from Week 2
  - Identify patterns (PRs, pain, plateaus)
  - Generate Week 3 workouts with AI
```

---

### WEEK 3: Nutrition Integration

#### Goal: Add meal planning to client service

```
☐ Read NUTRITIONIST-AI-PROMPT.md (understand legal disclaimers)

☐ Generate meal plan for 1 client (ChatGPT)
  - Use generic client profile (no real names)
  - Request sample meal plan with macros
  - Save in client nutrition/ folder

☐ Send meal plan to client (email or print)
  - Include disclaimer: "This is NOT medical advice"
  - Encourage them to consult RD if they have questions

  - Adjust future meal plans based on feedback
```

---

### WEEK 4: Manager Pitch

#### Goal: Secure partnership, funding, or compensation increase

```
☐ Monday: Customize manager pitch document

  - Add testimonials (if clients love new system)
  - Calculate ROI (time saved, revenue increase)

☐ Wednesday: Schedule meeting with manager
  - Request 30-45 min meeting
  - Send calendar invite with agenda
  - Attach pitch document (optional: let them read beforehand)

☐ Friday: Deliver pitch
  - Walk through document (10 slides or simple doc)
  - Focus on BENEFITS (not technical details)

☐ Sunday: Follow up
  - Send thank-you email
  - Answer any questions
  - Set deadline for decision (don't wait forever)
```

## 🔐 SECURITY CHECKLIST (CRITICAL)

### ✅ Safe AI Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Use Claude Code with real client files (local VS Code extension)
- ✅ Use Roo Code with real client files (local VS Code extension)
- ✅ Use Gemini Code Assist with real client files (local VS Code extension)
- ✅ Create generic client profiles for web-based AIs (ChatGPT, MinMax)
- ✅ Use Spirit Names in all AI prompts (PT-10001 "Golden Hawk")

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Paste full Master Prompts into ChatGPT web interface
- ❌ Paste full Master Prompts into MinMax v2 web interface
- ❌ Include real client names in any AI prompt
- ❌ Upload client photos to public AIs without client consent
- ❌ Share client data on unsecured cloud storage

### Generic Client Profile Template (For Web-Based AIs)

```
CLIENT PROFILE (EXAMPLE):
- Age: 35, Male, Beginner
- Goal: Weight loss (210→180 lbs, 6 months)
- Injury: Lower back chronic 2/10 (no heavy deadlifts)
- Gym: LA Fitness (standard equipment)
- Sessions: 3x/week, 60 min

REQUEST: Generate a lower body workout.
```

**This is safe** because:
- No real name
- No real ID
- Generic injury description
- Could describe thousands of clients

---

## 💡 AI PROMPTING BEST PRACTICES

### How to Get Better Workouts from AI

#### BAD PROMPT (Too Vague)
```
Create a workout for my client.
```

**Problem:** AI doesn't know client's goals, injuries, equipment, or fitness level.

#### GOOD PROMPT (Specific)
```
Create a 60-minute lower body workout for:
- Age: 35, Male, Beginner
- Goal: Weight loss
- Injury: Lower back 2/10 (avoid heavy deadlifts >225 lbs)
- Equipment: LA Fitness (dumbbells, barbells, cable machines)
- Last session: Goblet squat 30 lbs 3x10 (form excellent, ready for progression)

Focus: Quadriceps + glutes, core stability for back protection
```

**Result:** AI generates specific exercises, sets, reps, weights, coaching cues.

---

### How to Get Better Bootcamp Classes from AI

#### BAD PROMPT
```
Create a leg day bootcamp class.
```

#### GOOD PROMPT (Use Template from PHASE-0-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE)
```
I'm teaching a bootcamp class today:

CLASS DETAILS:
- Type: Leg Day
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Attendees: 15 people, ages 16-77 (mixed levels)
- Equipment available: Ankle weights (10 sets), dumbbells 5-50 lbs, bands (20), mats (20)

CLASS FLOW REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep class in sync (minimize setup time)
- Equipment transitions must flow (e.g., keep ankle weights ON if next exercise uses them)
- Offer beginner/intermediate/advanced modifications for ALL exercises

STYLE:
- Circuit training (3 rounds)
- 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest
- High energy, motivational coaching

Generate a 45-minute Leg Day bootcamp class plan.
```

**Result:** AI generates structured class with warm-up, 3 circuits, cool-down, equipment flow analysis.

## 📊 TRACKING SUCCESS (How to Know It's Working)

### Weekly Metrics to Track

```
WEEK 1 BASELINE:
☐ Time spent on admin per client: ___ min (probably 30+ min)
☐ Workouts created from scratch: ___ (all of them)
☐ Client retention: ___% (how many clients stayed)
☐ Revenue: $___

WEEK 4 TARGET:
☐ Time spent on admin per client: <10 min (67% reduction!)
☐ Workouts created from scratch: 0 (AI generates all)
☐ Client retention: 90%+ (clients love new system)
☐ Revenue: +20-50% (charge more, add clients, or both)
```

### Client Feedback Questions

After 4 weeks, ask clients:
1. "Do you feel like you're getting more attention now?" (Goal: Yes)
2. "Are the workouts more personalized?" (Goal: Yes)
3. "Would you recommend this service to a friend?" (Goal: Yes)

If all 3 are "Yes" → You're ready to scale (add more clients or raise prices)

---

## 🚨 COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem 1: "iPad workflow feels clunky"

**Solution:**
- Simplify quick-ref card (only 5-10 key facts)
- Use voice memos instead of typing notes (transcribe later)
- Print workout plan (easier than iPad swiping)

### Problem 2: "AI generates bad workouts"

**Solution:**
- Improve your prompt (be more specific: goals, injuries, equipment, last session)
- Use Claude Code instead of ChatGPT (better at structured tasks)
- Review AI output BEFORE giving to client (you're still the expert)

### Problem 3: "Client data sync is a mess"

**Solution:**
- Use iCloud Drive or Google Drive (auto-sync)
- OR stick with manual copy (AirDrop notes after session)
- Don't overcomplicate (Phase 0 is supposed to be simple)

### Problem 4: "Manager says no to partnership"

**Solution:**
- Ask for compensation increase instead (you're creating IP)
- Offer to license system to other trainers (revenue share)
- Build independently (you own the IP, license to other gyms)
