## 💡 STRATEGIC NOTES

### **Why AI Add-Ons Work:**

1. **Perceived Value Boost:**
   - $175/session feels expensive alone
   - $175 + $50 AI = $225 total, but framed as "premium tech-enhanced training"
   - Justifies higher pricing through innovation

2. **Upsell Path:**
   - Client starts with 8 sessions (no AI)
   - After 2 weeks: "Want daily check-ins? Add Golden AI Flight for $125/month"
   - Easy upsell because they're already committed

3. **Competitive Differentiation:**
   - No other personal trainers in your market have this
   - "AI-powered training" sounds cutting-edge
   - Justifies premium pricing vs. competitors at $60-100/session

4. **Recurring Revenue:**
   - AI add-ons are monthly subscriptions
   - Smooths cashflow vs. one-time session purchases
   - Example: 10 clients on Tier 2 = +$1,250/month recurring
