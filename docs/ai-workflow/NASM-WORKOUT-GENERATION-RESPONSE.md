## Training Frequency: 3-4 Days Per Week

**Recommendation**: **3-4 training days per week** as our standard programming frequency

**Rationale**:
- **OPT™ Compatibility**: Allows proper recovery between sessions (48-72 hours)
- **Adherence**: Realistic for working professionals and families
- **Progression**: Sufficient frequency for strength and hypertrophy gains
- **Recovery**: Adequate rest days for adaptation and CEx protocols
- **Business Model**: Fits client schedules while maintaining session demand

**Programming Structure**:
```
Week Structure: Mon/Wed/Fri (3 days) OR Tue/Thu/Sat (3 days)
OR Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri (4 days) for accelerated progression

Recovery Days: Focus on CEx protocols, mobility work, light activity
```

## Signature Training Styles: Circuits + Supersets + EMOM/AMRAP

**Recommendation**: **Circuits, Supersets, and EMOM/AMRAP** as our core training methodologies

**Rationale**:
- **Time Efficiency**: Perfect for 45-60 minute sessions
- **Metabolic Benefits**: Circuit training provides cardiovascular conditioning
- **Technique Focus**: EMOM/AMRAP encourages quality over quantity
- **NASM OPT Alignment**: Supersets are Phase 2 hallmark, circuits work across phases
- **Equipment Integration**: All styles work with bands, cables, DBs, machines
- **Progression Friendly**: Easy to scale difficulty across OPT phases
- **Client Satisfaction**: Variety prevents boredom, maintains engagement

**Style Applications by OPT Phase**:

### Phase 1: Stabilization Endurance
**Primary Style**: **Circuits** (focus on control and stability)
```
Example: 45-min Phase 1 Circuit
- 8-10 exercises, 12-20 reps each
- 60-90s rest between exercises
- 2-3 rounds total
- Emphasis on form and stability
```

### Phase 2: Strength Endurance
**Primary Style**: **Supersets** (strength → stabilization)
```
Example: Phase 2 Superset Protocol
- Strength exercise (8-12 reps) → Stabilization variant (8-12 reps)
- 45-60s rest between supersets
- 3-4 supersets per muscle group
- Metabolic stress with stability focus
```

### Phase 3: Muscular Development
**Primary Style**: **EMOM/AMRAP** (hypertrophy focus)
```
Example: Phase 3 EMOM Protocol
- Every Minute on the Minute: Complete 8-12 reps
- Rest remaining time in minute
- 10-12 minute blocks per muscle group
- Time under tension for hypertrophy
```

### Phase 4: Maximal Strength
**Primary Style**: **Traditional Sets** (heavy loading)
```
Example: Phase 4 Heavy Protocol
- 4-6 sets of 1-5 reps
- 2-3 minutes rest between sets
- Compound movements with heavy loads
- Technique emphasis with maximal effort
```

### Phase 5: Power
**Primary Style**: **Contrast Training** (heavy → explosive)
```
Example: Phase 5 Contrast Protocol
- Heavy compound (1-5 reps) → Light explosive (6-10 reps)
- 2-3 minutes rest between pairs
- Olympic lift variations and plyometrics
- Speed-strength development
```

## Sample NASM-Aligned Workout Generation

### Example 1: General Fitness - Phase 2 Strength Endurance (45 minutes)

**Title**: Full Body Strength Endurance Circuit - Phase 2 • 45 min
**Goal**: Improve muscular endurance while maintaining stability for general fitness

**Warm-Up (6 min)**
- 2 min light cardio (march in place, arm circles)
- Dynamic mobility: Leg swings (10/side), arm swings (10/side), torso twists (10/side)
- Corrective activation: Band pull-aparts (15 reps), glute bridges (10 reps)

**Main Workout (32 min)**
*Block 1: Lower Body Supersets (12 min)*
- A1: Goblet Squat | DB 25lbs | 3×10 | 2/1/1 | 60s rest
- A2: Single-Leg RDL | DB 15lbs | 3×10/side | 2/1/1 | 60s rest
- *Rationale*: Phase 2 hallmark - strength exercise paired with stabilization variant

*Block 2: Upper Body Circuit (12 min)*
- B1: DB Bench Press | DB 20lbs | 3×10 | 2/1/1 | 45s rest
- B2: Cable Row | Cable light | 3×12 | 2/1/1 | 45s rest
- B3: Overhead Press | DB 15lbs | 3×10 | 2/1/1 | 45s rest
- B4: Lat Pulldown | Machine light | 3×12 | 2/1/1 | 45s rest

*Block 3: Core & Conditioning (8 min)*
- C1: Plank | Bodyweight | 3×30s | Hold | 60s rest
- C2: Russian Twists | DB 10lbs | 3×20 | 2/1/1 | 45s rest

**Finisher (4 min)**
- EMOM: 10 Push-ups + 10 Squat Jumps (4 rounds)
- *Rationale*: Metabolic finisher to build work capacity

**Cool-Down (3 min)**
- Static stretching: Hamstrings, quads, chest, shoulders (20-30s each)
- Breathing: 4-4-4-4 box breathing for recovery

**Progression Notes**
- When to progress: Perfect form on all exercises, can complete all sets
- Next session: Increase DB weight by 5lbs if form maintained
- Regression: Reduce reps to 8 if form breaks

**Safety Considerations**
- Monitor for compensatory movements during squats
- Ensure proper scapular positioning on upper body exercises
- Stop immediately if sharp pain occurs (dull soreness OK)

**Homework/Recovery**
- Daily CEx: Foam roll tight areas (hips, thoracic spine)
- Mobility: Child's pose and doorway chest stretch daily
- Nutrition: Focus on protein intake (1.6g/kg bodyweight)

**Why this works (NASM OPT™ Phase 2 tie-back)**:
This workout follows Phase 2 Strength Endurance principles with supersets pairing strength exercises (higher load, stable base) with stabilization variants (same movement pattern requiring more control). The 8-12 rep range and moderate rests build muscular endurance while the circuit format maintains metabolic stress. All exercises integrate core stability and use our available equipment (DBs, cables, machines).
