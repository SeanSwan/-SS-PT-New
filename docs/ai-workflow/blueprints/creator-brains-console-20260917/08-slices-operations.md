# 08 — Implementation slices & operations — Creator Brains Console

Each slice: independently shippable, RED→GREEN tests before merge-worthy state, entry/exit evidence recorded in the packet (09/README). Review route per slice (Mega Blueprints v3.1): glm-5.3 → glm-5.3-flash → gpt-6-astra (Astra seat currently blocked until 2026-09-19 ~22:12 — slices before S5 can proceed on GLM reviews with the gap recorded; Astra adjudication batched when the seat resets, Sean permitting).

| Slice | Deliverable | Entry criteria | Exit evidence | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S0** | Bridge: `server.mjs` + `api.mjs` — **nine-route allowlist** (reads: `status`/`creators`/`run`/`canary`/`backlog`/`query`/`brains/:slug`; writes: `POST /api/creators`, `PATCH /api/creators/:id`) + loopback-only + `hostAllowed` DNS-rebinding gate + error envelope + T-B1/B2/B3/B6/B7/B8/B9 + structure suite | This packet plan-ready; engine suite green baseline recorded | `node --test` bridge suite green (RED observed first); curl-able JSON on fixture store; engine suite unchanged (additive only) | — |
| **S1** | Console web scaffold: Vite app, tokens.css (design.md §4 as `var(--token,#fallback)`), shell + StatusBoard + adapters (`ConsoleDataAdapter`, Local, Mock) | S0 exit | T-W1/W2/W3 green; `tsc --noEmit` 0; build ok; R2/R3 visible on real fixture store | S0 |
| **S2** | Roster + writes (add/enable/disable via engine functions) + BrainDrawer | S1 exit | T-B3, T-W4 green; drawer reads only published generation; damage paths banner | S1 |
| **S3** | QueryConsole + canary/repair/backup (OpsRail) — **adds `POST /api/repair` + `POST /api/backup` (deferred from S0; 05 §2b)** | S2 exit | T-B9/**B10**, T-W5 green; zero-hit + skipped honesty visible | S1 |
| **S4** | RunConsole: validated ops/hour, spawn, 2 s polling, RUN_LOCKED, verdict honesty — **adds `POST /api/run/daily` (deferred from S0; 05 §2b)** | S3 exit | T-**B4/B5**, T-W6 green; run against temp store completes with real journal verdict | S1 |
| **S5** | BrainConstellation (per picked concept direction): layout fn, interaction, reduced-motion dual gate, WebGL fallback, lazy chunk | S2+ (roster = accessible equal) | T-T1/T-T2/T-W7 green; T-E3 budget measured; Sean has seen it (ideation follow-through) | S2 |
| **S6** | Design dual-pass + responsive matrix (T-E2) + a11y (T-W9) + performance budgets + hostile review round on the whole console | S1–S5 exit | qa-gates.md receipt; 11-width matrix evidence; rule 23 critique fixes applied and listed | S1–S5 |
| **S7** | **GATED on Sean's explicit go:** best-state snapshot (git tag + copied tree + hashes) → duplicate into SwanGuard-Newsroom with SwanGuardAdapter handoff spec | S6 exit + Sean's go | snapshot hashes recorded; SwanGuard-side build receipt lives in THAT repo | S6, Sean |

**No-go boundaries:** no slice may modify engine files (README pointer edit excepted); no slice may add a transcript-reading path; no slice may expose restore/rollback/authorize; no commit without the slice's exit evidence; no push to main (Render untouched).

## Operations

- **Launcher:** `Creator Brains Console.cmd` (Desktop): runs `server.mjs`, which **binds first, then opens the default browser itself** (no stdout-parsing race), prints `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` for the record; close the console window = stop bridge; store is on disk — crash-safe by design. **Single-instance guard:** a pid file under the store root; a second bridge refuses with "already running (pid)" (T-B11) so two consoles can never write the store concurrently.
- **S7 embed note:** the web app declares `react`, `react-dom`, `styled-components` as **peer externals** in library mode so SwanGuard never gets a second React copy.
- **Logs:** bridge writes a rolling `console.log` under `.ai-workflow/creator-brains/console/` (gitignored): requests, spawn/exit of daily child, refusals with reasons. Metrics = the store's own run journal (no parallel truth).
- **Upgrade/rollback:** console is additive — `git` revert of the console slice range + delete Desktop `.cmd` = full rollback; engine CLI remains the always-working fallback at every point in time.
- **Perf budgets watched in ops:** initial bundle ≤500 KB gz, three chunk ≤900 KB gz, API p95 ≤50 ms, bridge boot ≤1.5 s (re-checked at S6 and any dependency bump).

## Unresolved decisions that gate building (not implementation details)

1. **D-CD (Sean):** pick CD1 / CD2 / CD3 (ideation gate). S5's shape depends on it; S0–S4 are direction-independent and may start after his go.
2. **D-Astra:** Astra architecture adjudication (one call, seat blocked until 2026-09-19 ~22:12). Recommended: batch it after the seat resets, before S5 (the three.js slice) — S0–S4 carry no design risk the adjudication would overturn.
3. **D-spend:** none — Astra rides the Codex subscription; no metered APIs in this plan.
