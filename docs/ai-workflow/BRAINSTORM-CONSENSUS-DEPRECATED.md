## 🔄 New System in Use

### For Active Reviews:

2. **Find Your Feature:** `reviews/[feature-name].md` - One file per feature
3. **Use Template:** [templates/PHASE-0-REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md](templates/PHASE-0-REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md) - For new reviews

### For Completed Reviews:
- **Archives:** `archive/completed-YYYY-MM.md` - Organized by month

### For Process Guidance:
- **How It Works:** [NEW-FILE-STRUCTURE-GUIDE.md](NEW-FILE-STRUCTURE-GUIDE.md) - Complete guide

## Why We Changed

**Problems with Old System:**
1. **File Size:** 1500+ lines, slow to load, hard to navigate
2. **Mixed Content:** Active, completed, and example reviews all in one file
3. **No Index:** Hard to find specific reviews
4. **Scalability:** Would have grown to 5000+ lines with more features

**Benefits of New System:**
1. **Lightweight Registry:** <300 lines, fast to load
2. **Focused Files:** One feature per file, max 800 lines
3. **Clear Organization:** Active vs completed vs archived
4. **Easy Navigation:** Registry provides clear index with status tracking

## Migration Status

- ✅ **Homepage Hero Enhancement:** Migrated to `reviews/homepage-hero-enhancement.md`
- ⬜ **Login Page Enhancement:** Not started (use new template)
- ⬜ **Admin Dashboard Enhancement:** Example only (not real review)

---

## What to Do If You End Up Here

1. **Go to:** [PHASE-0-REGISTRY.md](PHASE-0-REGISTRY.md)
2. **Find your feature** in the registry table
3. **Click the link** to the feature's review file
4. **If starting new review:** Use [templates/PHASE-0-REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md](templates/PHASE-0-REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md)

**This file will be deleted after all active reviews are migrated to the new system.**
