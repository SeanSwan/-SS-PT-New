## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure these environment variables are set in production:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...          # Real Stripe secret key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...     # Real Stripe publishable key  
REDIS_HOST=your-redis-host             # Redis for caching
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password     # Redis authentication
NODE_ENV=production                    # Production environment
```

### 2. Database Verification
```sql
-- Ensure these tables exist and have proper associations:
-- ShoppingCart, CartItem, User, StorefrontItem
-- Verify foreign key relationships are working
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "ShoppingCarts";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CartItems"; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Users";
```

### 3. Test Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy backend changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Real Stripe analytics integration complete"
git push origin main

# 2. Wait for Render deployment to complete

# 3. Test endpoints (see test-real-stripe-analytics.sh)
chmod +x test-real-stripe-analytics.sh
./test-real-stripe-analytics.sh production
```

### 4. Frontend Completion
```bash
# Complete remaining frontend components:
# 1. Update PendingOrdersAdminPanel data fetching
# 2. Connect BusinessIntelligence to real API
# 3. Keep retired bridge monitoring out of the active UI
# 4. Test all admin dashboard features
```
