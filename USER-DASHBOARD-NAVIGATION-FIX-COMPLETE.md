**Issue:** User Dashboard not prominently visible in header navigation
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Date:** Saturday, May 31, 2025

---

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

### **What Was Missing:**
The User Dashboard was technically connected but **hidden from easy access**:

- ✅ **Route Working:** `/user-dashboard` route properly configured
- ✅ **Component Exists:** Full-featured UserDashboard component implemented
- ✅ **Mobile Access:** Link visible in mobile menu
- ❌ **Desktop Visibility:** Only accessible via DashboardSelector dropdown
- ❌ **User Discovery:** Not immediately obvious to users

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### **Enhanced Desktop Navigation:**
Added direct "Profile" link to desktop navigation for logged-in users:

```tsx
{/* Direct User Dashboard Link - For easy access */}
<StyledNavLink 
  to="/user-dashboard" 
  className={isActive('/user-dashboard') ? "active" : ""}
  variants={itemVariants}
>
  <PersonIcon fontSize="small" style={{ marginRight: '4px' }} /> Profile
</StyledNavLink>
```

### **Navigation Structure Now:**
**For Logged-in Users (Desktop):**
- Home
- Store (dropdown)
- DashboardSelector (dropdown with all dashboards)
- **Profile** (direct link to User Dashboard) ← **NEW**
- Contact
- About Us

**For Logged-in Users (Mobile):**
- Home  
- Store (expandable)
- Admin Dashboard
- Trainer Dashboard
- Client Dashboard
