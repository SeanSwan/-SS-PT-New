## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Seed the Database

cd backend
node seeders/20250516-storefront-items.mjs
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Content

Check if packages were created:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price, "packageType", theme, "isActive" 
FROM storefront_items
ORDER BY price;
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
# Start backend (in backend directory)
npm start

# Start frontend (in frontend directory) 
npm run dev
```
