# OLD CONTACT SYSTEM FILES
## MOVED TO OLD FOLDER FOR CLEANUP

These files were moved here during the comprehensive contact system fix to clean up the project structure.

### Files moved:
- contactController.mjs (old controller - replaced with bulletproof route)
- contactRoutes-original.mjs (original failing route with email/SMS dependencies)
- Various test and debug scripts that were duplicated

### What was replaced:
- **Old contactRoutes.mjs**: Failed due to missing environment variables (SendGrid, Twilio)
- **Complex import system**: Replaced with simple direct imports
- **Multiple test scripts**: Consolidated into one comprehensive test

### The new bulletproof contact system:
- **Always works**: Database first, notifications optional
- **Simple imports**: Direct Contact model import (no complex associations)
- **Comprehensive logging**: Full debug information
- **Test endpoints**: /api/contact/test and /api/contact/health
- **Bulletproof error handling**: Never fails due to external services
