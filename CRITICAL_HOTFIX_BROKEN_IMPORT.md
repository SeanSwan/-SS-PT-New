# 🚨 CRITICAL HOTFIX - Broken Import Resolution

**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Build failure due to archived component import  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## 🔥 Critical Issue Identified

**Build Error:**
```
Could not resolve "./Pages/admin-dashboard/components/MCPServerManagement/MCPServerCommandCenter" 
from "src/components/DashBoard/UnifiedAdminDashboardLayout.tsx"
```

**Root Cause:** Import reference to archived `MCPServerCommandCenter` component that was moved during cleanup.

## ⚡ Immediate Fixes Applied

### **1. Removed Broken Import**
```typescript
// REMOVED:
import MCPServerCommandCenter from './Pages/admin-dashboard/components/MCPServerManagement/MCPServerCommandCenter';

// UPDATED SECTION TO:
// ENTERPRISE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IMPORTS
const SocialMediaCommandCenter = React.lazy(() => import('./Pages/admin-dashboard/components/SocialMediaCommand/SocialMediaCommandCenter'));
const EnterpriseBusinessIntelligenceSuite = React.lazy(() => import('./Pages/admin-dashboard/components/BusinessIntelligence/EnterpriseBusinessIntelligenceSuite'));
```

### **2. Updated Route to Use MCPServersSection**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<MCPServerCommandCenter />

// AFTER:
<MCPServersSection />
```

### **3. Enhanced Lazy Loading**
- Added proper `Suspense` wrappers for lazy-loaded components
- Implemented proper error boundaries and loading states

## 🛡️ Build Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Verification:**
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ All imports resolved 
- ✅ No references to archived components

## 📊 Impact
