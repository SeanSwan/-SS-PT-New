# YOLO MCP Server Dependency Issue - Python 3.13 Solution

## Problem
The YOLO MCP server failed to install due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues. The original requirements.txt specified older versions that only support Python 3.7-3.11.

## Solution

### Updated Requirements for Python 3.13

I've updated the requirements.txt file to use newer versions compatible with Python 3.13:
- `ultralytics>=8.1.0` (newer version with Python 3.13 support)
- `torch>=2.6.0` (available for Python 3.13)
- `torchvision>=0.20.0` (compatible with newer torch)
- Other dependencies updated to use flexible version constraints

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Install with Updated Requirements
```bash
# Use the updated Python 3.13 compatible script
install-yolo-deps-py313.bat

# Or manually:
cd backend/mcp_server/yolo_mcp_server
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 2: Install Minimal Dependencies
```bash
# Use minimal requirements for faster installation
cd backend/mcp_server/yolo_mcp_server
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

#### Option 3: Start Without YOLO (Immediate Development)
```bash
# Start system without YOLO MCP
npm run start-without-yolo

# Or use the dev alias
npm run start-dev
```

## Key Dependencies

The YOLO server requires:
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- PyTorch (`torch`, `torchvision`)
- Ultralytics YOLO (`ultralytics`)
- Additional ML/CV libraries

## Import Fixes Applied ✓

The import issues in the workout and gamification MCP servers have been resolved:
- No more "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" warnings
- Proper fallback import strategies implemented
- Both servers should start successfully

## Current System Status

- **Workout MCP (8000)**: ✅ Fixed imports, should start successfully
- **Gamification MCP (8002)**: ✅ Fixed imports, should start successfully  
- **YOLO MCP (8005)**: ⚠️ Requires dependency installation
- **Nutrition MCP (8003)**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Alternatives MCP (8004)**: ❌ Not implemented

## Recommendation

For immediate development and testing:
1. Use `npm run start-without-yolo` to start the core system
2. Verify that workout and gamification MCP servers start without import errors
3. Install YOLO dependencies later when AI features are needed

The core fitness platform functionality (workouts, gamification, user management) should work without the YOLO server.
