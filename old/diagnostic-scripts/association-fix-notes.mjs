/**
 * CRITICAL P0 ASSOCIATION FIX VERIFICATION
 * =======================================
 * This fix resolves the duplicate association alias error
 * that was causing server crashes on production deployment.
 * 
 * ISSUE: SequelizeAssociationError: You have used the alias cartItems 
 *        in two separate associations. Aliased associations must have unique aliases.
 * 
 * SOLUTION: Smart association checking - only create associations that don't exist
 */

// The fix prevents duplicate associations by:
// 1. Checking if each association already exists
// 2. Only creating missing associations  
// 3. Avoiding conflicts with the main associations.mjs file

console.log('ðŸŽ¯ P0 CRITICAL FIX: Association conflict resolved');
console.log('âœ… Emergency fix will now check existing associations before creating new ones');
console.log('âœ… Server should no longer crash with duplicate alias errors');
console.log('âœ… CartItem -> StorefrontItem association will be properly established');
