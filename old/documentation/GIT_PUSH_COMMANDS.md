## ‚úÖ After Successful Push

1. **Monitor Render Dashboard** - Should auto-deploy from main branch
2. **Check Deployment Logs** - Look for successful migration execution
3. **Verify Endpoints** after deployment:
   - `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
   - `https://your-app.onrender.com/health` 
   - `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/storefront`

**Expected Success**: Server starts cleanly with luxury packages created! ü¶¢‚ú®
