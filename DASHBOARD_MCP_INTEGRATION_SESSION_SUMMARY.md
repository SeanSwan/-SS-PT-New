üöß Open Issues/Blockers:
  - Need to connect the DashboardSelector to the main navigation in more places
  - AdminDashboardLayout and TrainerDashboardLayout may need additional MCP integration
  - Mobile responsiveness needs to be tested more thoroughly

üí° Potential New Issues/Watchouts:
  - The mock MCP services need to be replaced with real implementations in production
  - Performance might be affected by multiple data fetches; consider optimization
  - We should add caching for MCP responses to improve performance
  - MCP server error handling could be improved with more specific error messages

‚è≠Ô∏è Recommended Next Steps:
  - Create real MCP server implementations for production
  - Optimize data fetching with request batching or GraphQL
  - Implement more advanced gamification features like quests, rewards, and leaderboards
  - Add more visualization options for progress tracking
  - Create comprehensive documentation for MCP services and hooks
  - **GIT PUSH REMINDER:** Consider pushing these stable changes to your Git repository.
