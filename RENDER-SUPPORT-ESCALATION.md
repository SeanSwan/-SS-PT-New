# RENDER SUPPORT ESCALATION - CORS PLATFORM INTERFERENCE

## Issue Summary
**Problem:** Render platform is intercepting OPTIONS preflight requests and stripping CORS headers, preventing cross-origin requests from working despite correct application and render.yaml configuration.

## Service Details
- **Service Name:** swan-studios-api
- **Service URL:** https://swan-studios-api.onrender.com
- **Frontend Origin:** https://sswanstudios.com
- **Plan:** Starter
- **Region:** Oregon

## Evidence of Platform-Level Issue

### 1. Application Logs Show Correct CORS Processing
```
🌐 INCOMING REQUEST: GET /health from origin: https://sswanstudios.com
✅ NON-OPTIONS: Origin 'https://sswanstudios.com' allowed - headers set
✅ LAYER 4 - CORS: Origin 'https://sswanstudios.com' allowed by traditional middleware
🏥 Health check from origin: https://sswanstudios.com
```

### 2. Browser Shows CORS Headers Missing
```
Access to fetch at 'https://swan-studios-api.onrender.com/health' from origin 'https://sswanstudios.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
GET https://swan-studios-api.onrender.com/health net::ERR_FAILED 404 (Not Found)
```

### 3. OPTIONS Requests Never Reach Application
- Application has comprehensive request logging for ALL methods
- Backend logs show GET requests from frontend origin
- **ZERO OPTIONS requests appear in application logs**
- Browser DevTools confirm OPTIONS preflight requests are being sent

### 4. Multiple CORS Strategies All Failed
- ✅ Platform-level headers in render.yaml (corrected syntax)
- ✅ Ultra-aggressive 4-layer application CORS middleware
- ✅ Explicit OPTIONS route handlers
- ✅ Wildcard CORS fallback
- **All strategies show identical symptoms**

## Technical Configuration

### render.yaml Headers
```yaml
headers:
  - path: /*
    name: Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    value: "*"
```

### Application CORS (4-Layer Strategy)
```javascript
// Layer 1: Ultra-priority middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin || '*');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, HEAD');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', '...');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
    return res.status(204).end();
  }
  next();
});

// + 3 additional CORS layers for redundancy
```

## Request for Resolution

**Issue:** Render's platform proxy appears to be:
1. Intercepting OPTIONS preflight requests before they reach the application
2. Stripping CORS headers from responses before they reach the browser
3. Potentially causing routing issues (404 errors despite successful backend processing)

**Request:** Please configure the platform to:
1. Forward OPTIONS requests to the application layer
2. Preserve CORS headers set by the application
3. Respect render.yaml header configuration for OPTIONS requests

## Immediate Impact
This prevents a production application from functioning, blocking all cross-origin API requests from the frontend to the backend.

## Timeline
- **Initial Issue:** Discovered multiple days ago
- **Attempted Fixes:** 6+ different CORS configurations
- **Evidence Gathered:** Comprehensive logging confirms platform interference
- **Escalation:** All application-level solutions exhausted

- **Backend URL:** https://swan-studios-api.onrender.com

## Additional Notes
The application works perfectly in development with localhost origins. The issue only occurs with the production Render deployment, strongly indicating platform-level interference rather than application configuration problems.
