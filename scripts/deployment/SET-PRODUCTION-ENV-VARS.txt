ðŸš¨ URGENT: SET PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN RENDER DASHBOARD
========================================================================

Your backend service is crashing because of placeholder environment variables.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find and click on your "swan-studios-api" service  
3. Click on the "Environment" tab
4. Look for these variables and UPDATE them with real values:

CRITICAL VARIABLES TO UPDATE:
============================

JWT_SECRET
   Current: "your-jwt-secret-key-here"
   Update to: [Generate a 32+ character random string]
   Example: "kJ8x9mP2qR5sT7uV0wZ3yB6nC9fH1gL4oS8vE2rT5yU7iP0qA3sD6gH9jK2mN5pR"

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET  
   Current: "your-jwt-refresh-secret-here"
   Update to: [Generate a DIFFERENT 32+ character random string]

ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE
   Current: "admin-access-code-123"
   Update to: [Your chosen secure admin code]
