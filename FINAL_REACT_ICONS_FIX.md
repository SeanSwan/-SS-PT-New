# 🔧 FINAL REACT-ICONS FIX - DEPLOY NOW!

## ⚡ LAST BUILD ERROR RESOLVED

**❌ Error:** `Rollup failed to resolve import "react-icons/fa" from "ConstructionBannerContainer.tsx"`  
**✅ Solution:** Replaced all react-icons with lucide-react in ConstructionBannerContainer  
**Status:** ✅ ALL REACT-ICONS DEPENDENCIES ELIMINATED  

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Final react-icons Import:**

// ❌ BEFORE (causing build failure):
import { FaWrench, FaCalendarAlt, FaEnvelope, FaTimes, FaInfoCircle } from 'react-icons/fa';

// ✅ AFTER (build-safe):
import { Wrench, Calendar, Mail, X, Info } from 'lucide-react';
```

### **Icons Replaced:**
- `FaWrench` → `Wrench`
- `FaCalendarAlt` → `Calendar`  
- `FaEnvelope` → `Mail`
- `FaTimes` → `X`
- `FaInfoCircle` → `Info`

### **Verification Complete:**
