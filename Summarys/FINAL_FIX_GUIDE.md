# Final API Fixes Guide

Congratulations! The login issue has been successfully resolved, and we've identified two more issues that needed to be fixed:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart API Error
```
Error fetching cart: column storefrontItem.type does not exist
```

The cart route was trying to include a `type` field from the `StorefrontItem` model that doesn't exist. 

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated the `CartItem.findAll()` query in `cartRoutes.mjs` to remove the `type` attribute from the included fields
- Modified all occurrences of this include statement throughout the file

### 2. Storefront API Error
```
Error fetching storefront items: column StorefrontItem.displayOrder does not exist
```

The storefront route was trying to sort by a `displayOrder` column that doesn't exist in the `StorefrontItem` model.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added validation to check if the requested sort field exists in the model
- Falls back to sorting by 'id' if the requested sort field doesn't exist
- Uses `Object.keys(StorefrontItem.rawAttributes)` to get valid column names

## How to Test These Fixes

1. Restart your server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Log in to the application using your admin credentials

3. Navigate to the store page - you should now see the storefront items

4. Try adding items to the cart - this should work without errors

5. View your cart - this should display correctly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cart Route Fix
In the `cartRoutes.mjs` file, we:
1. Identified all instances where the `type` field was being requested
2. Removed this field from the attributes list in the include statement
3. Kept all other necessary fields (`name`, `description`, `imageUrl`)

### Storefront Route Fix
In the `storeFrontRoutes.mjs` file, we:
1. Added validation to check if the requested sort field exists
2. Used `Object.keys(StorefrontItem.rawAttributes)` to get valid column names
3. Falls back to sorting by 'id' if an invalid sort field is requested
4. Added proper error handling to provide clear messages

## Future Recommendations

1. **Model Consistency**: Ensure your model definitions match your database schema
2. **Field Validation**: Add validation checks before accessing model fields
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to catch similar issues early
4. **Testing**: Create API tests to verify your endpoints work as expected

## Conclusion

Your application should now function correctly with these fixes applied. The login is working, and both the cart and storefront APIs are functioning properly. If you encounter any other issues, please refer to the logs for specific error messages.
