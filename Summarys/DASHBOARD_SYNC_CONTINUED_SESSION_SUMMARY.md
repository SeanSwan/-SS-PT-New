--- End DIFF SUMMARY ---

üöß Open Issues/Blockers:
  - Need to connect DashboardSelector to main layout components
  - DashboardRoutes may need updates to support proper navigation
  - Need to test with actual MCP server data
  - Further styling refinements needed for complete consistency

üí° Potential New Issues/Watchouts:
  - Chart components may need performance optimization for large datasets
  - DashboardSelector permissions need thorough testing with different user roles
  - Need to ensure consistent data format between MCP server and visualization components
  - Mobile responsiveness should be thoroughly tested

‚è≠Ô∏è Recommended Next Steps:
  - Integrate DashboardSelector into main navigation components
  - Create a dedicated dashboard page for easy navigation between dashboards
  - Add more specialized chart types for specific metrics (stacked bar, heatmap)
  - Create custom hooks for each chart type to simplify data preparation
  - Add export functionality to save progress reports as PDF/image
