2. **main.jsx** - Added viewport fix initialization for better mobile experience

## Key Improvements

### 1. Mobile-First Design Approach
- All new styles follow mobile-first principles, starting with mobile layouts and scaling up
- Media queries are organized to progressively enhance the experience on larger screens
- Touch-friendly design with appropriate tap target sizes (min 44px) for better mobile usability

### 2. Consistent Responsive Behavior
- Standardized breakpoints across the application (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, xxxl)
- Responsive utility classes for consistent spacing, typography, and layout
- Fluid typography that scales proportionally with viewport width

### 3. Flexible Layout Systems
- ResponsiveGrid component for creating complex grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Flexbox helpers for responsive flex-based layouts
- Container components that maintain appropriate margins on all device sizes

### 4. Common Mobile Issues Fixed
- Fixed the "100vh" issue on mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari)
- Improved handling of orientation changes and device rotations
- Eliminated layout shifts during page load and transitions
- Ensured form inputs are properly sized on mobile (16px font to prevent zoom)
- Made all tables horizontally scrollable on small screens

### 5. Enhanced Accessibility
- Improved focus states for keyboard navigation
- Added skip-to-content link for keyboard users
- Ensured sufficient color contrast for all content
- Added ARIA attributes where needed
- Support for reduced motion preferences

### 6. MUI Component Enhancements
- Responsive styling for MUI dialogs, cards, and form components
- Mobile-optimized DataGrid and Table components
- Improved touch interaction for MUI form controls

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Added will-change hints for smoother animations
- Optimized media loading for faster perceived performance
- Implemented content-visibility for off-screen content

## Implementation Notes

### How to Use the New Responsive Utilities

#### Responsive Grid
```jsx
import { ResponsiveGrid, GridItem } from '../components/common/ResponsiveGrid';

<ResponsiveGrid 
  columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 3, lg: 4 }}
  gap="20px"
>
  <GridItem colSpan={{ xs: 1, md: 2 }}>
    Wide item on larger screens
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>Standard item</GridItem>
</ResponsiveGrid>
```

#### Breakpoint Usage in Styled Components
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import device from '../styles/breakpoints';

const ResponsiveComponent = styled.div`
  padding: 10px;
  
  ${device.md} {
    padding: 20px;
  }
  
  ${device.lg} {
    padding: 30px;
  }
`;
```

#### Fluid Typography & Spacing
Use the responsive utility to create fluid typography and spacing:

```jsx
import { responsive } from '../styles/breakpoints';

const FluidComponent = styled.div`
  ${responsive.fluid('font-size', '16px', '24px')}
  ${responsive.fluid('padding', '16px', '32px')}
  margin: ${responsive.space(16)};
`;
```

#### Full Height Elements (iOS Fix)
For full-height elements that need to work correctly on iOS:

```jsx
<div className="full-height">
  This will be 100% of the viewport height on all devices
</div>
```

### Testing on Different Devices
- The application has been optimized for a wide range of devices from mobile phones to ultra-wide screens
- Remember to test on actual devices, especially iOS Safari where most viewport issues occur
- Use the responsive design mode in browser developer tools for quick testing of different screen sizes

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing Container Queries when browser support improves
- Explore advanced responsive image loading techniques for faster page loads
- Add specific optimizations for foldable devices and unusual screen ratios

## Conclusion
These improvements establish a solid foundation for consistent, accessible, and pixel-perfect responsive design across all devices. The modular approach allows for easy maintenance and extension as the application grows.
