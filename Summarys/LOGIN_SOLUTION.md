# Login Authentication Fix Solution

## Problem Identified
Based on our verification, we discovered the root cause of your login issue:

**There is no user with the username 'ogpswan' in the database.**

This is why you're receiving the 401 Unauthorized error - the user simply doesn't exist in your database.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Force Create Admin User

We've created a script that will force-create an admin user with known credentials:

```bash
# Run from the project root directory
npm run force-create-admin
```

This script will:
- Check if the admin user already exists
- Create a new admin user if it doesn't exist
- Update the password if the user does exist
- Display the login credentials

### 2. Login with the Provided Credentials

After running the force-create-admin script, you'll see login credentials in the console:

```
üîê ADMIN USER READY! üîê
-------------------------------------
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: password123
-------------------------------------
```

Use these credentials to log in.

### 3. Verify Storefront Items

After successfully logging in, check if your storefront items are displayed properly. If not, run:

```bash
npm run seed-storefront
```

## How This Solution Works

The force-create-admin script:
1. Connects directly to the database
2. Creates a new admin user with the username 'admin'
3. Sets a known password ('password123')
4. Uses direct SQL queries to ensure reliability

This approach ensures you have a working admin user regardless of any prior issues.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Verify the admin user exists:
```bash
npm run verify-password
```
Enter 'admin' as the username and 'password123' as the password.

2. If database connection issues persist, verify:
   - PostgreSQL is running
   - Database credentials are correct in .env
   - No firewall is blocking the connection

3. As a last resort, reset the entire database:
```bash
npm run db:reset
npm run force-create-admin
npm run seed-storefront
```

## After Successful Login

Once you're logged in, you can:
1. Create additional users
2. Change passwords through the application UI
3. Continue developing your application

The admin user created by this script has full access to all admin features, allowing you to fully test and configure your application.
