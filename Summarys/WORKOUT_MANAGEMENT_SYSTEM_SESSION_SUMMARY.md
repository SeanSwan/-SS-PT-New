- **Client progress monitoring** and active workout tracking
- **Integrated with shared workout components** for consistency

##### Client Dashboard
- **EnhancedMyWorkoutsSection** with real workout tracking capabilities
- **In-workout timer and rest periods** with RPE tracking
- **Progress visualization** and workout history
- **Real-time workout logging** to MCP server

#### 4. Shared Infrastructure
- **Centralized component exports** via index.ts
- **Consistent styling** using Material-UI dark theme
- **Error boundaries** for robust error handling
- **Loading states** and offline mode support

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### MCP Integration Architecture
- **Direct API calls** to workout MCP server (localhost:8000)
- **Tool-based architecture** matching MCP server structure
- **Automatic retry logic** and error recovery
