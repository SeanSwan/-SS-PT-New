# SwanStudios Cart Functionality Fixes

This document outlines the cart functionality fixes that have been implemented to resolve the issues with the cart system in your fitness platform application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Error (401 Unauthorized)**: Fixed the cart API calls to properly include authentication tokens, resolving the 401 Unauthorized errors in the console.

2. **Button Text Fix**: Changed all "View Plan" buttons on storefront cards to consistently display "Add to Cart" as requested.

3. **Cart Synchronization**: Properly connected the header cart count with the cart context, ensuring the count updates correctly when items are added.

4. **Floating Cart Enhancement**: Implemented a "follow" behavior for the cart button that elegantly transitions as users scroll through the page.

## Technical Changes

### 1. CartContext.tsx Changes

- Added explicit authorization headers to all cart API requests
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced token validation and state management
- Fixed cart initialization and update logic

### 2. Header Component Changes

- Connected the header cart icon to the CartContext instead of using static count
- Ensured the cart badge updates in real-time when items are added
- Imported the useCart hook and used the proper cart state

### 3. StoreFront Component Changes

- Changed all subscription and non-subscription buttons to display "Add to Cart"
- Simplified the click handlers to always call handleAddToCart
- Added CSS classes and transition effects for the floating cart button
- Implemented scroll-aware behavior for the cart button with smooth animations

## How to Apply the Fixes

You can apply all these fixes automatically by running the included script:

```bash
node cart-fixes-apply.js
```

The script will:
1. Create backups of your original files
2. Apply all the necessary changes
3. Provide confirmation of successful changes

After running the script, restart your development server to see the changes take effect.

## Manual Verification

After applying the fixes, you should verify:

1. **Authentication**: Log in as a client and confirm no 401 errors in the console when viewing the store
2. **Button Text**: All cards should display "Add to Cart" buttons (no "View Plan" text)
3. **Cart Count**: The count in the header should match the count in the cart popup
4. **Cart Following**: The cart should elegantly follow you as you scroll down the page

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after applying the fixes:

1. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify that you're properly logged in
3. Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode
4. Restore from backups (located in ._backup folders) if needed

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain the existing styling and theme of your application
- All cart interactions are properly authenticated using your JWT token system
- The cart buttons now have enhanced visual feedback with glow effects and transitions
- We've added proper TypeScript types and error handling throughout the cart system

This completes the cart functionality fixes as requested. Your clients should now be able to add items to cart without errors and enjoy a better shopping experience.
