### File: C:\Users\ogpsw\Desktop\quick-pt\SS-PT\frontend\src\tests\hooks\useClientDashboardMcp.test.tsx
Scope: Testing
Type: New Feature
Errors Fixed: None
Key Changes:
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for the useClientDashboardMcp hook
  - Added tests for initialization, error handling, and refresh functions
  - Set up mocks for MCP service APIs and AuthContext

## Open Issues/Blockers
None identified.

## Potential New Issues/Watchouts
- The backend controllers assume that both MCP servers are running and accessible
- Make sure to run the migration script before starting the server
- The SyncStatus and SyncNotification components assume the lastSyncTime is available in the useClientDashboardMcp hook

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Run the migration script to update the database: `node update-client-progress.mjs`
2. Start the backend server and verify the new endpoints are available
3. Start the frontend and test the synchronization between client and admin dashboards
4. Run the unit tests for the useClientDashboardMcp hook
5. Consider implementing more sophisticated error handling for when MCP servers are unavailable
6. Add more comprehensive logging for synchronization activities
7. Consider implementing a background synchronization service for regular updates
