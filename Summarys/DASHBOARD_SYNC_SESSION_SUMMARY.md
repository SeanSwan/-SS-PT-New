🚧 Open Issues/Blockers:
  - Need to implement complete MCP server integration with the backend API
  - TrainerDashboard routes need to be fully implemented
  - Session-based tabs need implementation across all dashboards
  - Need to implement real data connection with MCP server when available

💡 Potential New Issues/Watchouts:
  - Ensure MCP server is properly initialized before accessing endpoints
  - Check for potential memory leaks in useEffect cleanup in ProgressSection
  - Need to test dashboard access across different user roles
  - Watch for potential state inconsistencies between backend and MCP servers

⏭️ Recommended Next Steps:
  - Implement TrainerDashboard routes and content pages
  - Add Session tab implementation across all dashboards
  - Create actual data visualization components for the Progress section
  - Implement user switching between dashboards for admin/trainer roles
  - Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time updates
