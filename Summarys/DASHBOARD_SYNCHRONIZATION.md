# Dashboard Synchronization and MCP Integration

## Overview

This documentation outlines the changes made to synchronize the client, admin, and trainer dashboards in the SwanStudios Platform. Additionally, it details the integration of the client progress tab with the workout and gamification MCP servers.

## Key Changes

### 1. Tab Standardization

We've standardized the dashboard tabs across all user roles to ensure a consistent user experience:

**Common Tabs (All Dashboards):**
- Dashboard/Overview
- Client Progress
- Workouts
- Sessions
- Gamification
- Community

**Additional Admin Tabs:**
- Users
- Packages

**Additional Trainer Tabs:**
- Clients
- Packages

**Additional Client Tabs:**
- Creative Hub
- Profile
- Settings

### 2. MCP Server Integration

The client progress tab has been integrated with both the workout and gamification MCP servers:

- The `ProgressSection.tsx` component now fetches data from both MCP servers
- Added error handling and loading states
- Implemented fallback to mock data when servers are unavailable

### 3. New Components and Services

**New Components:**
- `TrainerDashboardLayout.tsx`: Created a TrainerDashboard layout with consistent navigation
- `WorkoutProgramsView`: Added to AdminDashboardLayout for the Workouts tab

**New Services and Hooks:**
- `clientProgressService`: Service to manage client progress data
- `useClientDashboardMcp`: Custom hook for integrating with MCP servers

### 4. Routing Structure

- Updated the admin dashboard routes to include Workouts tab
- Created `DashboardRoutes.tsx` for centralized dashboard routing
- Updated the Client Dashboard to include the Sessions tab

### 5. Configuration

- Created `dashboard-tabs.ts` to centralize tab configuration across dashboards

## How to Use

### Accessing MCP Data in Components

Use the `useClientDashboardMcp` hook to access MCP data:

```jsx
import useClientDashboardMcp from '../../hooks/useClientDashboardMcp';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    progress, 
    gamification, 
    loading, 
    error,
    fetchClientProgress,
    fetchGamificationProfile 
  } = useClientDashboardMcp();
  
  // Use the data in your component
  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      ) : error ? (
        <p>Error: {error}</p>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <h2>Level: {progress?.overallLevel || 0}</h2>
          <p>XP: {progress?.experiencePoints || 0}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Services API

The `clientProgressService` provides methods for working with progress data:

```js
// Get client progress
const result = await clientProgressService.getClientProgressById(userId);

// Update client progress
const result = await clientProgressService.updateClientProgressById(userId, {
  overallLevel: 10,
  experiencePoints: 500
});

// Get leaderboard
const result = await clientProgressService.getLeaderboard();

// Get achievements
const result = await clientProgressService.getAchievementsByUserId(userId);

// Log activity
const result = await clientProgressService.logClientActivity(userId, 'workout_completed', {
  workoutId: '123',
  duration: 45,
  exercises: 10
});
```

## Future Improvements

1. Implement complete data synchronization between backend and MCP servers
2. Create dedicated TrainerDashboard routes
3. Add more detailed progress visualization components
4. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
5. Create a unified navigation service for switching between dashboards
