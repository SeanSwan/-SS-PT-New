# Dashboard Testing Instructions\n\n## Current Issue\nThe dashboard navigation was not working properly because:\n1. No trainer user role was defined in the mock users\n2. The dashboard selector wasn't always visible\n3. Navigation was routing to home page instead of dashboards\n\n## Solutions Implemented\n\n### 1. Added Mock Users for All Roles\n- **Admin**: `admin@swanstudios.dev` (role: 'admin')\n- **Trainer**: `trainer@swanstudios.dev` (role: 'trainer')\n- **Client**: `client@swanstudios.dev` (role: 'client')\n- **User**: `user@swanstudios.dev` (role: 'user')\n\n### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Selector\n- Now shows all dashboard types\n- Role badges indicate current user's permissions\n- Always visible when user is logged in\n- Fixed routing to correct dashboard paths\n\n### 3. Development Tools Added\n- **Debug Panel**: Top right corner showing user state and dashboard access\n- **User Switcher**: Bottom right corner for quick role switching\n\n## How to Test\n\n### Quick Testing Steps:\n1. **Use the User Switcher** (bottom right floating button)\n   - Click the user icon to open the switcher\n   - Select different user types (Admin, Trainer, Client, User)\n   - Each user type will have different dashboard access\n\n2. **Check Dashboard Access**\n   - Admin: Can access all dashboards\n   - Trainer: Can access trainer, client, and user dashboards\n   - Client: Can access client and user dashboards\n   - User: Can only access user dashboard\n\n3. **Dashboard Navigation**\n   - Look for the \"Dashboard\" dropdown in the header (between Store and Workout Tracker)\n   - Click it to see available dashboards\n   - Disabled dashboards appear grayed out based on current user role\n\n### Manual Login Testing:\nIf you prefer manual login, use these usernames:\n- Login with `trainer` - Will use trainer mock user\n- Login with `admin` - Will use admin mock user\n- Login with `client` - Will use client mock user (default)\n- Login with `user` - Will use regular user mock user\n- Any password works in development mode\n\n### Current Dashboard Routes:\n- **Admin**: `/dashboard/default`\n- **Trainer**: `/trainer-dashboard`\n- **Client**: `/client-dashboard`\n- **User**: `/user-dashboard`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### If dashboards still redirect to home:\n1. Check the Debug Panel (top right) to see your current user role\n2. Ensure you're using the correct username for the desired role\n3. Clear localStorage if needed: `localStorage.clear()`\n4. Try logging out and back in\n\n### If Debug Panel or User Switcher don't appear:\n1. Ensure `VITE_DEV_MODE=true` in your .env file\n2. The components only show in development mode\n3. They automatically hide in production builds\n\n## Notes\n- All dashboards are now created and functional\n- The trainer dashboard includes client management and session scheduling\n- The user dashboard includes profile settings and preferences\n- Role-based protection is in place for all dashboard routes\n\nFeel free to test by switching between different user types using the User Switcher!
