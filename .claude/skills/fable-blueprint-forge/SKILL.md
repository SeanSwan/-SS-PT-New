description: Fable-as-architect, cheaper-AI-as-builder. When Sean wants a feature planned so completely that ANY competent builder AI (Codex, ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet, a fresh session with zero repo context) can build it exactly as Fable would — architecture docs, Mermaid flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERDs, ASCII/HTML wireframes, file-by-file build order, exact signatures/paths/copy/tokens, "do NOT" bans, and executable per-slice acceptance criteria — then Fable reviews each built slice at the boundary. Kills vibe-coding: the plan makes every decision so the builder makes none. Distinct from fable-deep-sight (reads what EXISTS), grill-me (extracts intent), chromie (pressure-tests the bet) — this FORGES the build package. Use when Sean says "blueprint this", "forge the plan", "make it so another AI can build it", or /fable-blueprint-forge.

# Fable Blueprint Forge

## Role

Fable (or the strongest available Claude, per the Final Decider fallback chain) is the **architect**.
A cheaper/high-token AI is the **builder**. The builder will fill every gap in the plan with its own
judgment — and a weaker model fills gaps worse. So the Forge's job is to leave **no gaps that
matter**: every place a builder *could* choose, the plan chooses for it. The output is a
self-contained build package a builder with ZERO repo access or context can execute faithfully.

Three laws (the whole skill in one breath):
1. **Decision-dense, not just long.** Exact file paths, exact function signatures, exact API
   request/response shapes, exact copy strings, exact palette tokens, explicit "do NOT" bans.
2. **Executable acceptance criteria per slice.** Not "auth works" — "these N named tests pass;
   this exact curl returns this exact JSON; this viewport renders this wireframe."
3. **Fable checkpoints, not Fable absence.** Builder types; architect reviews every slice
   boundary. Review-a-diff costs a tiny fraction of write-the-code.

## Pipeline position

`grill-me` (intent) → `chromie` (if the bet is unproven) → **`fable-blueprint-forge`** (this skill:
plan package) → builder executes slice-by-slice → **Forge checkpoint** per slice → `closeout-evidence-lock`
+ rule 48 audit record at phase close. The Forge does NOT replace recursive planning (rule 15) — it
IS the maximal form of it.

## When To Use

- Sean wants a substantial feature/system planned by the best brain and built by a cheaper one
  (Codex worktree agent, ChatGPT/GPT-5.x, a fresh Claude session, a Workflow fleet).
- The builder will NOT have repo access, or will have limited context — the package must carry
  everything.
- Sean says "planned, not vibe-coded," "blueprint everything," "wireframes and mermaids," "build it
  exactly like Fable would."

## When NOT to use

- Small slices Claude/Codex can just build under normal rules (15/17/26) — the Forge overhead isn't
  worth it below ~a multi-day feature.
- Intent is still fuzzy → run `grill-me` first. Bet is unproven → `chromie` first. The Forge
  assumes the WHAT is decided; it forges the HOW.
- Auditing existing code → `fable-deep-sight`.

## Phase 1 — Repo Truth Harvest (architect side, before writing a word of plan)

The #1 way handoff plans fail: they cite files/routes/models that don't exist or have drifted.
Before forging, gather with file:line evidence:
- Canonical surfaces the feature touches (rule 26 receipt discipline; route mounts, mounted JSX).
- Real model columns from model files + drift check (rule 58) for every table touched.
- Existing patterns to copy (rule 18): one working in-repo example per pattern the builder will
  need (a styled-component card, a route+controller pair, a Victory chart, a test file shape).
- The mount points: exactly where new routes/components/nav entries plug in.
Paste the relevant excerpts INTO the package — the builder can't grep the repo.

## Phase 2 — Forge the Build Package

Write to `docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/BLUEPRINT-<feature-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/` as a small doc set
(one dir, numbered files, each ≤~300 lines so any builder can load them piecemeal):

1. `00-README.md` — what this is, build order, how to use the package, the Builder Contract (below).
2. `01-architecture.md` — system overview, component tree, data flow, **Mermaid**: `flowchart` for
   user/data flows, `sequenceDiagram` for every API interaction, `erDiagram` for schema (new +
   touched tables, exact column names/types), state diagrams where state machines exist.
3. `02-wireframes.md` — ASCII wireframes for every screen/state (desktop + 375px mobile), or an
   HTML mockup file per screen for visual surfaces. Every button, label, empty/loading/error state
   drawn. Exact copy strings. Exact palette tokens (`var(--token, #fallback)`).
4. `03-contracts.md` — every API endpoint: method, exact path, auth requirement, request JSON,
   response JSON (success + each error), status codes. Every exported function the builder must
   create: exact signature with types. Every model: full Sequelize definition text.
5. `04-build-order.md` — **file-by-file**: for each file — path, purpose, ≤300-line budget, what it
   imports, what it exports, which in-repo example to mimic (excerpt included), and the slice it
   belongs to. Ordered so every slice leaves the app bootable.
6. `05-slices.md` — the slice plan. Each slice: scope (files), the decisions already made,
   **executable acceptance criteria** (named test files + counts, exact curl + expected JSON,
   exact viewport checks), and STOP line: "do not proceed to slice N+1 until checkpoint passes."
7. `06-bans.md` — the "do NOT" list: house rules restated for a context-free builder (no MUI;
   styled-components only; Victory only; no hardcoded colors; 44px targets; dark-first; no
   yoga/meditation wording; zero PII to LLMs; ≤300 lines/file; `css` helper for shared style
   fragments; FKs reference `"Users"`; no `git add -A`; commit style `type(scope): desc`) PLUS
   feature-specific bans ("do NOT create a new route file for X, mount in Y", "do NOT touch Z").
8. `07-checkpoints.md` — the checkpoint protocol (Phase 3) and the review remit text to reuse.

**Decision-density self-test before calling the package done:** read each slice as a hostile
builder and list every choice you'd still have to make. Each one is either (a) decided in the
package now, or (b) explicitly delegated with bounds ("builder's choice, must satisfy X"). Zero
silent gaps. This is the Forge's rule-17 hostile pass.

**Privacy/secrets:** package is committed — IDs/roles only, no PII, no secrets, no env values
(rules 8/44). Run `bash scripts/scan-secrets.sh` over the package dir.

## Phase 3 — Builder Execution + Checkpoints

**Builder Contract (paste into 00-README.md and the builder's first prompt):**
> You are the builder, not the architect. Follow the package to the letter. Where the package
> decides, you do not re-decide — even if you'd do it differently. Where the package is silent on
> something that matters, STOP and return the question; do not improvise. Build ONE slice at a
> time; after each slice, output the diff + the acceptance-criteria evidence (test output, curl
> results, screenshots) and WAIT for the checkpoint verdict before continuing. Never claim a
> criterion passed without pasting its output.

**Checkpoint (architect side, per slice):** diff review against the package — (1) every acceptance
criterion verified with real output; (2) drift scan: anything built that the package didn't specify,
anything specified that wasn't built, any ban violated; (3) verdict `PASS / REVISE (list) / HALT`.
Checkpoints may run on paid Fable (ask Sean first, rule 16 / free-first ladder) or the free
triangle / strongest local Claude when Sean prefers $0. Log verdicts in
`07-checkpoints.md` or the rule-67 review queue.

## Output Contract (chat, when the package is forged)

```text
BLUEPRINT FORGE: <feature> — PACKAGE READY
Location: docs/ai-workflow/AI-HANDOFF/BLUEPRINT-<slug>-<date>/
Slices: N · Files planned: N · Diagrams: N mermaid + N wireframes
Decision-density self-test: PASS (0 silent gaps / N delegated-with-bounds)
Secret scan: PASS
Builder target: <Codex worktree | ChatGPT | fresh Claude | workflow fleet>
First slice + its acceptance criteria: <one line>
Checkpoint plan: <who reviews, paid or free>
```

## Hard Rules

- Architect never skips Phase 1 — a plan citing unverified repo state is vibe-planning (rules
  26/58 apply to the PLAN, not just code).
- Paid Fable authorship/checkpoints are spend-gated: ask Sean first; offer the free ladder.
- The package must work for a builder with ZERO repo access — no "see CLAUDE.md", no "grep for
  X"; everything needed is IN the package.
- Builder deviations are never merged silently — REVISE or HALT, and drift found at checkpoint
  goes back to the builder, not patched by the architect (or the token economics invert).
- Rule 48 audit record still lands at phase close; the package + checkpoint log feed it directly.
