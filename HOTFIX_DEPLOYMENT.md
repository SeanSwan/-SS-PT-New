# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT HOTFIX

## Issue Fixed
- **Error:** `Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/backend/mongodb-connect.mjs'`
- **Cause:** MongoDB files were archived during cleanup but imports weren't updated
- **Fix:** Removed MongoDB imports from `startup.mjs` - PostgreSQL-only architecture

## Changes Made
1. **backend/core/startup.mjs:**
   - Removed: `import { connectToMongoDB, getMongoDBStatus } from '../mongodb-connect.mjs';`
   - Removed: MongoDB connection code in `initializeDatabases()`
   - Updated: Added PostgreSQL-only architecture logging

## Production Status
- ‚úÖ Pre-deploy seeding: **SUCCESSFUL** (8 luxury packages created)
- ‚ùå Server start: **FAILED** (MongoDB import issue)
- üîß Hotfix: **APPLIED** (MongoDB dependencies removed)

## Next Steps
1. Push hotfix to trigger new Render deployment
2. Monitor Render logs for successful startup
3. Test production endpoints
